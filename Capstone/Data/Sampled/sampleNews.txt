Write it down. If you're doing an internship for credit, you'll probably be asked to create a portfolio of your work to be graded. But take the time to do what Sarah Jackson did when she was doing her internship at the Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site. The McKendree University junior kept a log of what she did, but also of what she learned. It's a great way to chart your progress and to reinforce the knowledge or skills you've gained.

"Obtaining recognition by the IRS as a public charity is an embarrassingly easy thing to do," the study concluded. "It is hardly an exaggeration to say that when it comes to oversight of the application process to become a public charity, nearly anything goes."
The program is intended as a temporary lifeline. It will last until 2014, when the new health law requires insurers to accept all applicants regardless of medical history. Insurers will also be prohibited from charging higher premiums to those in poor health. And many people will be eligible for new tax credits to help pay premiums.
Among the additions was a House-approved mortgage lending bill that prohibits lenders from steering borrowers into higher cost loans. The measure would extend protections for tenants in foreclosed properties from December 2012 to December 2014. Displaying the influence of black lawmakers, the House additions also would require federal financial agencies to set up an office of Women and Minority Inclusion to promote diversity.

Société Générale's computer systems are considered some of the most complex in banking for handling equity derivatives, that is, investment contracts whose value moves with the value of other assets. Officials of the bank believe Mr. Kerviel spent many hours of hacking to eliminate controls that would have blocked his super-sized bets. Changes he is said to have made enabled him to eliminate credit and trade-size controls, so the bank's risk managers couldn't see his giant trades on the direction of indexes.

Portland actress Ellen Bloodworth also gave voice to lots of locals' feelings in her own "Portlandia" scene. Another first-episode sketch featured Armisen as a member of an adult hide-and-seek league playing in a Portland Community College library. Bloodworth's character sits down at a table with a book, only to discover Armisen's character hiding under the table. He asks her not to give him away; she looks at this grown man playing a kids' game and asks him, in a tone of grandmotherly common sense, "Why don't you just get a job and go to work like a normal person?"

Lohse led the Cardinals' rotation in wins and he had the lowest ERA of the staff. He did that despite being skipped, pushed back and generally jerked around at times during the season. As much as his numbers look good against his peers, the way the club shifted him around and took care to skip his start at one point is just as revealing. The club was, midway through the season, concerned about his inconsistency. Manager Tony La Russa at one point suggested that he felt Lohse was ailing physically but not acknowledging it to the team. Lohse insisted that he didn't seek treatment from the trainers because he didn't need it.

European nations, which became the first to commit to the IMF fundraising effort in December, have pressed other countries to help shore up the fund's resources. Europe's beefed-up crisis fund would likely be insufficient if Italy and Spain—the euro zone's third- and fourth-biggest economies, respectively—needed rescue packages. Many analysts doubt even the two combined firewalls—in Europe and the IMF—would be enough.

If he is, than that has to be the world's highest radar level. Right now, if you're underestimating Edwin's scoring ability than you either don't care or aren't paying attention. Saturday afternoon, Edwin tallied a career-high 24 points in the win over Providence. Tuesday night, he had 24 points — in the first half. By the end of the night, he had set a new career-high with 28 points and has firmly established himself as a bona fide scorer. The Paterson Catholic product has always been thought of as a slasher, but now he's become a true scoring threat. In the last two games, he is 9-of-13 from 3-point range and is an absolute nightmare on the fast-break. He was really locked down in the second half by DePaul — something which we expect he'll see more of — but to be honest, Edwin's probably eclipsed Herb Pope as the second scoring option for this year. For now, at least.

Coach Andrew Schoonover says he has five players capable of scoring 20 points in a game.
Portland fans have two things to ponder, tanking-wise. There is the Blazers' own pick. Also, the Blazers have New Jersey's first-round pick, but it is top-three protected, meaning the Nets keep it this year if they finish with one of the top three picks.
Going into the next game, the key for us is not being overconfident, knowing that what we did Sunday was miraculous. We can’t do that again. We just have to play with the same effort and heart that we played with in the fourth quarter and we’ll be in a better position to win.

By late October and early November, when the 2009-2010 novel H1N1 vaccine became widely available, the virus was spreading quickly throughout Europe and North America. As a result, many patients were likely exposed to the virus after getting the vaccine but before their bodies were able to mount an immune response -- a process that takes at least two weeks. That timing hitch may have driven down the vaccine's apparent effectiveness, said Lone Simonsen, an epidemiologist with George Washington University and an expert on influenza, in an interview Tuesday.
Last week, a House committee endorsed a bill to change that. Its backers say they are hopeful for its passage this year. According to that bill, a TIF commission's rejection could be overridden only by two-thirds of the voters in the taxing districts.

Season 10 winner Patrick House looked trim and terrific, and Season 12 winner John Rhodes was there as well.

Tracey from Season 8 was there, looking good.

Patrick Burkhart, assistant director of Maricopa County's Human Services Department, who oversees Maricopa Workforce Connections, said he is seeing evidence that companies shutting down plants are just consolidating and moving the jobs elsewhere in the U.S., not overseas.

"We're dealing with 18-, 19-, 20-year-old young men -- you can expect anything every day and that's what makes it so exciting," Beilein said. "We never want them to have any regrets. We want them to be 100% certain. So you don't talk somebody into something, you don't talk them out of it. You just give them information and rely on their family, their education, the information you give them, to make a good decision."

A: Orchid cacti, also known as epicacti or epiphyllums, are native to tropical rain forests from Mexico to Argentina. The ones we grow are likely to be hybrids, often a mix of more than two species.

They thrive in potting mix high in organic content, preferably from decayed leaves, with perlite or coarse sand to provide excellent drainage.

The cute, colorful marionettes hanging on the walls and the harlequin- patterned stained glass above the kitchen pass-through have been jettisoned for mirrors and polished strips of reddish-copper moabi wood, which helps open up the room. A large floating frame of pearly Venetian plaster hangs from the ceiling, adding a sophisticated elegance to the otherwise boxy room. Rich copper-brown drapes now cover the opening in front of the kitchen.
"We were hoping to inspire Americans to commit to taking one 'combat shower' a week, until all the troops come home, so for those 3 minutes in the shower, they can connect to and share in the sacrifice of our armed forces," Hale wrote. "I've heard many soldiers say that things are very different from WWII, where the war seemed to affect every family. ... I've not seen any kind of 'poor me' attitude ... I think in part because this is an all volunteer Army ... but I do get the sense that soldiers feel like most Americans have no idea of the burden that our armed forces and their families have carried this past decade."

The reference was to former Sen. Santorum's explanation that he had voted with party leaders, and against his principles at times, to "take one for the team." Santorum has emerged as a favorite of evangelicals for his well-publicized anti-abortion stance, but Gingrich is trying to undercut that image as a principled conservative.
Trouble is, this formula-driven, female-friendly fluff certainly doesn't work as wonderfully as it did in "The Notebook," "Nights in Rodanthe," or even the lesser "Dear John," to name a few better Sparks-based movies.
Does it? Is not running an option?
"I'm hoping that we will close some of the loopholes on pay-to-play," Greenstein said. "I think we need to decouple the process of campaign contributions from the process of getting contracts, and much of that is done at the county and local level."

Budget Moms make more than 70 percent of the household purchasing decisions and account for some 80 percent of consumer spending. They fill up the family car with gas and know the high price at the pump is a result of this administration's failed energy policy.
Guess what? The same is true now that the lockout is over and the Bears are packing for training camp. That's why center Olin Kreutz and defensive tackle Anthony Adams shouldn't be the first people the Bears' general manager calls when teams are allowed to contact free agents today.
Some companies use their long history as a deliberate part of their marketing strategy.
Neela Paniz, who owned the very successful Bombay Cafe in Los Angeles, sold her business in 2007 with plans to retire.

Lastly, register in advance. Customers can book an animal up to 24 hours before their flight, but the airline has a limit of six pets per cabin (not including service animals), Lindsey says.
Q. The worst note to get, I think, is “I don’t like this character.” Because, you know, who says you have to like him? Does anyone really like Coriolanus? Do you want to buy Hamlet a beer?

"We once again welcome the review and input of the Auditor of state," Triozzi said in an e-mailed statement.
Spring training and some of the stadiums are as much a part of the fabric of their Florida communities as the teams are back in their permanent cities. The Detroit Tigers have trained in Lakeland — between Tampa and Orlando — since 1930 and have played in the current park, Joker Marchant Stadium, since 1966. The Philadelphia Phillies have played in Clearwater since 1947, and the Pittsburgh Pirates have called Bradenton’s McKechnie Field home for the past 43 years, although the place got a complete and much-needed facelift in the 1990s.
The palace was holding two parties, one hosted by the queen for 650 guests, and an evening dinner dance for 300 close friends. The queen and her husband have promised to go away for the evening, leaving the younger royals free to party the night away— and Harry to make his best man's speech away from his grandparents' ears.

''We can't predict what's going to happen, so we just watch the players as they come off (the board)," Patriots coach Bill Belichick said. "When we have opportunities, we take advantage of them.

But the ACJ isn't placated. While it endorsed the construction slenderizing, it also told the Judicial Council that it should suspend all courthouse contracting "until the budget picture becomes more clear," noting that the courts could face even more budget cuts due to lower-than-expected state revenue. The Alliance also is seeking an independent review of construction costs by the state auditor.
Stents are used to prop open blocked arteries and improve blood flow, and Midei is considered by those in his field to be exceptionally skilled at placing them.

And yet, the last time I talked to a County Council member — just two days after 4-year-old Ellie Bland was killed in March — Josh Wagner said: "I'm still committed to driving on the beach. People just need to understand it's a road."
Michigan currently exempts all Social Security and public pension benefits from income taxes, as well as up to $45,120 a year for a single return and $90,240 on a joint return in private retirement and pension benefits.

"She wants fans her own age," says Zach Hochkeppel, senior vice president of marketing at EMI Music and a member of the singer's Blue Note Records team from the start. Older audiences can be stodgy. "To maintain this über-adult fan base is really difficult. You have to do the same record over and over, or come up with stunts," such as standards collections or duets albums.
But where did this story come from, and how did it end up as the capstone to a collection of gospels and letters about Jesus that seem so strikingly different in tone and content?
Sound of Ideas: Last week on the program, Barbara Snyder, president of Case Western Reserve University, visited to talk about plans to increase the amount of student aid through the university's $1 billion fundraising campaign.

A little flexibility on his part resulted in a lot of changes on their end.
I don't want to say all foodies are dingbats because that would be unfair. And all dingbats are not foodies.

But the odds were stacked against Precious, and reality is unflinching. Sapphire spares no one. Her conscience is guided by life as it is, not as she might wish it would be.
Instead, four simple steps can nudge your body composition back into the safety zone -- and none involves the words diet, calories or weigh-in.

It has opened deep divisions between the main political parties, accentuated the challenge Prime Minister David Cameron faces in explaining his past ties to Murdoch and some of his top executives in Britain, and added new momentum to regulators' scrutiny of Murdoch's controlling interest in the British Sky Broadcasting network, or BSkyB, that is one of the most lucrative Murdoch investments.

Marschke's neighbors Richard Bradstreet, 65, who served in the Navy Seabees, and 68-year-old Army helicopter pilot Jim Krull, both Vietnam vets, both said they would not display the flag upside down. But they support Marschke's right to do so.
Auto makers have good reasons to go along with government efforts to mandate higher fuel economy. Europe and China are ahead of the U.S. in demanding advanced petroleum-saving technology. In Europe, for example, the European Union has set a target for average carbon dioxide emissions of 95 grams per kilometer by 2020—the equivalent of about 65 miles per gallon. That means a lot of highly efficient diesel subcompacts.
"A lot of great things have started in garages in Silicon Valley," Lee says. "So I figured I'd use mine to set up a boudoir photography studio."
The town is threatening something akin to wholesale destruction if voters do not approve the override on June 19: Thirteen of the town’s 27 police officers would be laid off, leaving no overnight shift. The library, senior center, additional fire station and recreation center would close.
The peak came in 2002, just as Sarbanes-Oxley was rewriting the rules, with 80 public companies vying for a Star 50 ranking. We've been skating close to the 50 edge for years, as company after company left the fold. Last year's ranking compared 52 companies.
Here's where I generally insert some incredibly insightful comment about the legendary CPS bunker and how the agency will hunker down to cover up yet another botch job. But not today.
Her brioche French toast ($8) is a disk of moist sweetened bread paved with beads of coastal huckleberries, drizzled with honey and bee pollen, and arranged beside a scoop of sweet corn ice cream.
In addition, the agency said the methodology used to build the new map was more sophisticated than that for the 1990 version, so the maps aren't directly comparable. The new map relies on data from 8,000 weather stations and also takes into account topography, prevailing wind, elevation, proximity to large water bodies and other factors not used to create the 1990 map.
The brawny left-handed hitter passed Paul Konerko on Chaparral's single-season home run record list this year and leads the state with 17 home runs. Cozens transferred from Desert Mountain last year.
Redmond, Fawcett's troubled son with actor Ryan O'Neal, was jailed April 5 for a probation violation - heroin possession.
As recently as 2009, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell did not acknowledge a link between head injuries on the field and brain diseases later in life. But the league has taken steps to better protect players in the past few years, and last month expanded the definition of <U+0093>defenseless players<U+0094> who may not be hit in the head or neck.
Yates, whose injury is to his non-throwing (left) shoulder, says he will play against Cincinnati. If he isn't able to go or should he get hurt during the game, the 3½ quarters of play that Jake Delhomme received could mean the difference in advancing in the playoffs or seeing the season come to an end.
Corzine later lobbied his company's main regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, on new rules,-- including one related to the handling of client money. He held a call with former Goldman colleague and CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler in July, according to public records.
Also order: The baked barbecue pork bun ($2.50/3) is sweet, sticky and soft, but desperately needed more of the filling to balance out the sweetness of the bun. The wrappers on crisp spring rolls ($2.50/3) hold up well against the mushroom and cabbage filling. Other interesting choices range from the steamed beef tripe with ginger and scallion to shark's fin soup.
The Rangers, bracing for the possibility Hamilton will demand a longer contract than they're willing to provide, considered signing Fielder, a slugging first baseman, this past winter. They figured Fielder would not only anchor their offense but also make it much more palatable to let Hamilton walk away.
Coach Jason Garrett said all will play, although the Cowboys could move Jenkins before the season. He said Claiborne is a difference maker worth the gamble.

The American Football League dared to take on the NFL in 1960. The Broncos dared to become an AFL charter member. The late Bob Howsam was the Broncos' first owner before he later gained greater fame as the architect of Cincinnati's "Big Red Machine" baseball team in the mid-1970s.
Regarding "Twitter becomes a key real-time tool for candidates" (Page A6, Sunday), it is a great concept to use technology to promote campaigning. What better way could the candidates' supporters feel secure with the candidate? They are able to get the word around by using hash tags and allowing their supporters to retweet their tweets.
The average rate on a five-year adjustable-rate mortgage rose to 3.70 percent from 3.69 percent. The five-year hit 3.25 percent last month, the lowest rate on records dating back to January 2005.

"Where the Wild Things Are," about a boy named Max who goes on a journey — sometimes a rampage — through his own imagination after he is sent to bed without supper, was quite controversial when it was published, and his quirky and borderline scary illustrations for E.T.A. Hoffmann's "Nutcracker" did not have the sugar coating featured in other versions.
The punch line was in reference to Gilbert's "Washington Generals" email he sent to Stern when the Cavs owner thought the league would allow Chris Paul to be traded from New Orleans to the Los Angeles Lakers.
FOREST GROVE -- David Yim had humble beginnings on downtown Main Street. In search of a small, country setting, Yim settled into his new hometown of Forest Grove in 2005 with his wife and two children. He initially stuck with what he knew, opening David OK Market

Attempts to reach Mr. Bo and Ms. Gu directly and through intermediaries weren't successful.
In the first moments of the Fox News Channel debate, as the candidates each made the case for why he or she should be the Republican nominee, Perry quickly invoked Tebow. But the Texas governor, still foundering in the polls, wasn’t simply trying to hook his wagon to a football star. He was also giving a coded shout-out to the religious conservatives so crucial to his candidacy in Iowa and elsewhere.
NEWARK — Six people were shot early this morning, two of them fatally, in four separate incidents in Newark early this morning, according to WABC-7 and News 12 New Jersey.
The imbroglio revolves around a ketch called Shawnee that was built in Massachusetts in 1915, first seen by a young Holland in San Francisco in the 1950s, brought to Newport Beach years later, and ultimately delivered into his talented woodworking hands - and his yard - in 2006 with its planks rotted, its bolts rusted and its paint peeling.

Now 42 years old, Rivera will be a free agent after this year. He expressed confidence, rightly so, that the Yankees would want him back.
If you want to be green -- on Earth Day and every other day of the year -- then eat green. Enjoy fresh produce, eat bean burritos instead of beef burritos and explore new vegan foods, such as marinated tofu kebabs, curried chickpeas and falafel. If you're going to a ballgame, order a veggie dog rather than a hot dog -- pork is the fourth most environmentally harmful food on the EWG's list. If you're going to pick up litter by a waterway, remember that factory-farm runoff is a leading source of water pollution and opt for a vegan lunch, such as a veggie burger or some lentil soup. The planet, animals and your body will be better off.
Because if "Ghost Protocol" makes one thing clear, it's that there are plenty of great missions ahead.

It's difficult to estimate how much the drop in visits will cost resorts. Skier visits, especially in today's age of discount season passes, can range in worth from a few bucks from the ski-area local who logs 120 days to several thousand from the vacationer who stays in a luxury slopeside hotel and books private lessons.
Chadwick was hired by UC Santa Cruz in 1967 to start a student garden project. The failed Shakespearean actor captivated students with his integration of storytelling, poetry and philosophy. "He knew a lot about mythology, so he would start talking about the technique of growing roses and then he would tie it into a Greek myth and the history of rose cultivation in the world," La Rose says. "He was a real synthesizer in a lot of different disciplines."
"Players who are in the game have to make responsible decisions. You can't leave your feet, change your mind in the air, just see the defense and not just the offense. There's a time to drive and a time not to."
On a lighter note, Obama disclosed his elder daughter Malia's summer vacation plans: the 12-year-old will be spending a month at camp, something she's never done.
Mostly, however, Bastianich's stories make him sound like a jerk. He says Mexicans are the hardest-working restaurant employees but Ecuadorians and Peruvians generally have "more culinary aptitude." He once stole flowers from a church cemetery to bring to a legendary chef of Roman cuisine. He claims that if you tell him what restaurants you frequent, he has a good idea of how much money you make.

The 19-year-old, who is blind, mildly autistic and coping with cerebral palsy, has friends, said Bill Craver, his foster father. But there's something about the judgment-free camaraderie of the KidCare after-school program that strikes a chord with Blue. Even on a day when he is in a wheelchair recovering from foot surgery instead of shooting baskets, he is cheered by the kids, their banter and their handmade get-well cards.
Henson said that if the board felt the costs affected the district negatively, board members wouldn't take the trips.

But Tannehill threw 15 interceptions last season and 21 in his 19 college starts. He also lost a number of fourth quarter games. But the Aggies' struggles had more to do with Texas A&M's poor defense, and inconsistent receivers than Tannehill's ability.
Douglas disagreed, saying the underground reservoir concept has been around for a century, and more of it will have to be done if the country is going to find renewable sources of energy and meet growing demand.

But Apple didn't upgrade the front-facing camera; it's the same low-resolution one as before, which makes for grainy pictures and video calls. And it didn't add a flash to the new back camera, which means you won't be able to take decent pictures at night.
April 22 - STP 400, Kansas City, Kan. (Denny Hamlin)
MEXICO: To the outside world, Mexican music is sombrero-and-suit-wearing mariachi bands that play at the local restaurant, but there’s much more. Los Tigres Del Norte are legends of the oompa-driven norteño sound, while Café Tacuba is considered the Radiohead of Mexico City, and Tijuana’s Nortec Collective melds countrified folk with dance-floor beats. More infamously, traditional corrido music now celebrates the exploits of drug runners, but is nonetheless extremely popular.
Desai said at the meeting the IEPA recommends the option that would consolidate the contaminated materials into a 35-acre site, allowing the remaining 100 acres to be used for development. It is the lowest-priced option.
Cohen, a Brit, made his name on HBO's "Da Ali G Show" but "Borat" made him a star. Fisher, raised in Australia, wowed audiences in "Wedding Crashers" and "Confessions of a Shopaholic."
Last time, I looked at why something that's bad for us—getting a big tax refund—feels good. Our rational side knows we shouldn't give Uncle Sam an interest-free loan by overpaying our taxes throughout the year, but our emotional side seems to prefer getting a big chunk of change at tax time.
DETROIT -- Parts shortages from three months of catastrophic flooding in Thailand have forced Honda to cut U.S. and Canadian factory production by 50 percent for the second time this year, the automaker said Monday.
Back when Indians players wore T-shirts beneath their uniforms that read, "It don't mean a thing till we get the ring," April at Progressive Field was the start of long "high-level practice" for the postseason. You know, the way the last week has been for the LeBrons at The Q across Gateway Plaza.
Cohen wanted a source inside every mosque within a 250-mile radius of New York, current and former officials said. Though the officials said they never managed to reach that goal, documents show the NYPD successfully placed informants or undercovers — sometimes both — into mosques from Westchester County, N.Y., to New Jersey.
Desai called his friend’s parents, his friend’s wife and everyone else he could think of who might change his friend’s mind.

Hiring freezes combined with attrition, and in some cases layoffs, have caused municipal police departments to shrink about 11 percent between Jan. 1, 2009 and Sept. 10, 2010, according to the PBA, which represents officers in 423 of New Jersey’s 566 municipalities. Those layoffs mean 2,228 fewer officers across the state.

However, I question the very public banging of heads against the Establishment Clause over a dubious thesis: that Christian thought has been booted from the public square. God knows that with the advent of the Internet, Twitter and other avenues, the freedom to preach and proselytize hasn't been constrained — only the use of government venues to showcase those focused ideals in America's pluralistic society.
"And they stepped over the line," he said, "with subsequent acts by management to avoid being exposed for failing to follow the law."
"The job of president isn't a normal job and the situation we're in isn't normal," snapped Sarkozy, riffing off of the Socialist Hollande's promise to bring a "normal" presidency compared to the incumbent's high-energy tenure. "Your normalcy isn't up to the stakes."
Soon enough, we encountered a massive wall of gray rock that turned out to be Hogan Dam. When you ride parallel to the dam, the climb doesn't look like much. But we were getting tired, and this climb began to sap our strength. Yes, we were running out of gas. But that's part of the plan: If you finish a big ride and still feel fresh, maybe you didn't go hard enough.

She posted a 176-133 record at St. John's, guiding the Red Storm to four NCAA tournament appearances, including the past three seasons, and a spot in the Sweet 16 this year.
Bartolotta, however, is confident. His kicking throughout the summer was accurate and strong. He is convinced a 50-yard field goal is well within his reach - Warriors assistant coach Tim Brengle boomed a 50-yarder to set the Fox record in 2000 - and while waiting for chances to help the offense, Bartolotta will focus on punting (a new duty) and kickoffs.

The Tigers returned all but one player from last year's final four team, and all of those guys contribute one way or another. Luebke has to make sure he gets the ball to the right spot on the court but also to the right people. Spreading the wealth isn't as easy as Luebke makes it look. He said he tries to exploit an opponent's defensive weaknesses while feeding everyone a steady diet of opportunities.

He placed a disposable aluminum pan at the bottom of the barbecue to collect the drippings and piled approximately 25 coals on each side of the pan. Then he scattered a handful of pre-soaked hickory wood chips on top for smoke and flavor.
Why? Maybe he doesn't feel any different -- normal with "silent" conditions like high blood pressure. Or maybe taking pills makes him feel old and sick, when he sees himself as young and strong. Or maybe he thinks the BP reading was wrong. Or he doesn't believe it's as bad as the doc says. (It is.) Or he's afraid of side effects. Or he's just suspicious of prescription drugs -- some people are.

The second notice recently popped up just in front of the other easy-to-spot red marker facing eastbound traffic, according to a Road Rant tipster. (The city's not guilty of adopting a double standard, either, as westbound motorists get the same two-for-one deal.)
Alexander said all of those unanswered questions make it nearly impossible to predict if or when any of the competitors will be able to produce a viable alternative to the iPad.
The rationale for taxing the wealthy at a lower rate is that they'll create jobs for the poor via the "trickle-down" theory. That theory has proven to be a destructive falsehood, forcing the poor to carry the wealthy on their backs.
That said, Wilson didn't make a lot of friends last year, whether he was cursing out a resident assistant at a dorm or acting like a punk on a radio show. There's been concern from the start that he hasn't quite acted the part of a high-profile coach when he has been away from the field.

Mike Danko, an attorney in San Mateo who has sued PG&E several times over earlier gas-related issues, said pipeline fires can be started when a small leak travels along the pipeline onto smaller lines and then into a house. There, ignition can happen when a switch is turned on for something such as an air conditioner or a light. The fire then swiftly travels to the original pipeline leak.

"It's going to take months to perfect," Brooks Laich said. "In the D-zone we want to be a lot more aggressive. Traditionally, you want to have a defenseman in front of the net, but he's preaching for us to get out. Maybe a little more man-to-man."

A lot of American space-program enthusiasts are finding hard to swallow the notion that the country that supposedly “won” the moon race is now reduced to paying the Russians for a lift into space — aboard essentially the very same spacecraft we beat. Believe it or not, Soyuz originally was developed to be the former Soviet Union’s moon ship.

3. Kudos to the Cardinals for making the quick decision to retire Tony La Russa's No. 10. Great manager, historically prominent manager, an obvious move. One thing that intrigues me though: I think that Billy Southworth has to be one of the most (if not the most) overlooked figures in Cardinals history. He managed the Cardinals for 6+ seasons. He went 620-346 for an astounding winning percentage of .642. The Cardinals won the World Series in 1942 and 1944 with Southworth as manager, and the 1943 team won 105 games and the NL pennant. No, Southworth's career as manager was relatively short, but he led an amazing run for the franchise. In a pleasant surprise, the Veterans Committee honored Southworth by voting him into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2008. I believe the Cardinals should do more to recognize Southworth's prominent role in one of the most illustrious eras in franchise history.
She explained, "It's not uncommon for refugees to struggle with adapting to a set of laws and cultural norms and expectations that are very different to what they are used to."

Had Mattingly played on better Yankee teams, I think he would be getting more Hall of Fame consideration. I feel this way because Mattingly's career numbers are nearly identical to those of the late Kirby Puckett, who was enshrined in Cooperstown in 2001, which was his first year on the ballot.
If I had a favorite Dodger, it was Sandy Koufax. He was modest and unassuming, and he left at the height of his career when he could have played longer. He had enough strength to walk away and not stay too long as some do.

And of course, I know that this was only the start. Poetry slams are a performance art that involves public competition. I imagine that some of the students will develop the poems they started further, to present on stage for an audience. Others may revise them in a more traditional mode, thinking of publication. Or maybe none of Monday's poems will go any farther than the circle of readings.

This martial, gangland-style of campaigning apparently makes the people in the campaigns feel hardheaded, professional and Machiavellian. But it's not clear that it's actually the best way to win an election. That's because the style is based on a series of dubious assumptions: that the harshest language is the most persuasive to voters; that what feels good to you as a competitive combatant will also look most attractive to detached onlookers; that over the duration of a six-month campaign, daily combat will continue to look compelling rather than cumulatively revolting; that in a campaign dominated by "super PAC" negativity, a presidential candidate is better served by wading into the brawl rather than separating himself from it.
Bachmann -- newest to the race -- drew one of the loudest rounds of applause Monday night from a partisan debate audience when she predicted that Obama would not win re-election. He is "a one-term president," she declared.

"His arm speed is unbelievable," Orioles pitching coach Rick Adair said of Wada's change-up. "He's got great arm action and can throw it for strikes, throw it for a chase. He knew what he was doing.

Like other government politicians during the campaign, he clung to familiar themes, citing the start of the bloody independence struggle against France that ended in 1962—rhetoric that has little resonance with the 70 percent of the population that is under the age of 30 and afflicted by a 20 percent unemployment rate.

“That hurt us,” said Dana Altman. “We were a little worried; I thought if we could keep it even and not get him his third we’d be in better shape. In retrospect we were probably a little too cautious. We probably should have stayed with him. He was 3-for-3 in the first half and was giving us a little offense.”
Winner: Eagles. They traded up from No. 24 to No. 13, got a top pass rusher - Michigan defensive end Brandon Graham - and didn't have to surrender their two second-round picks to do so. While trading Donovan McNabb to the Redskins this offseason wasn't a wise move, Graham will give the Eagles a fine young pass rusher to get after McNabb twice a year.

After Randy Foye's missed three-pointer early in the first quarter, Griffin jumped over Gasol's back on a tip-back dunk. Later, Gasol blocked Griffin's six-foot jumper as the Lakers held a 98-96 lead with 6:15 remaining. Gasol's 12 points on five-of-nine shooting pales to the production of Bynum (35 points) and Bryant (31). But Gasol's two assists to Bynum and a tip-in off Ramon Sessions' missed floater late in the fourth quarter helped keep the Lakers' lead intact. Griffin's 15-point performance featured the two aforementioned highlight reel dunks, but Gasol held him to seven-of-16 shooting.
On Wednesday, Ford President of the Americas Mark Fields said those concessions have allowed the automaker to bring 1,340 jobs back to the company's U.S. plants from suppliers or Ford plants in Mexico. By the end of 2012, Ford plans to bring back another 635 jobs.
We already fund the TSA through taxes, a "9/11 Passenger Security Fee" and a ticket tax of $2.50 per flight. Although a TSA spokesman emphasized to me that the program is free during the initial phase, I'm troubled by a screening initiative that could someday cost participants extra.

We do an examination to make sure everything's healthy, tissues look good, and that we don't see any abnormalities in there. But the majority of our time on that first visit is to educate the caregivers. We're kind of like the pediatricians of the mouth. So it's like a well-baby visit. We give them cues on diet, such as when they should be getting off the bottle if they're on one, and drinking milk and juice only with a meal.
She wasn't sure she was ready for more responsibility herself. A high-school dropout, she had earned an equivalency degree, but worked mostly in temporary clerical jobs.

We did talk to a dentist who suggested that if you do try an over-the-counter teeth whitener, to make sure you include your dentist in the conversation so you can get proper guidance. There are sensitivity issues with some people and also a dentist can better direct where the whitening agent needs to be applied. Also, the dentist we talked to, Dr. Denton Kimbrough, said people with deep-seated staining of the teeth from years of coffee or cigarettes probably will not be helped by an over-the-counter teeth whitening product.

øThis season we have been on top of the East most of the year, but not without the plague of injuries that has hit every other team. Looking back, having five new players and having a starting point guard go down early in the season, each one of us has had to step up to the plate and fill additional roles.

A: No, but it does suit my persona. You're right, everything about me as a DJ is out of style and out of step. I didn't grow up wanting to be famous or wanting to be a celebrity.

Because of employee turnover, it behooves a hotel to keep training in the fore. And it behooves the customer to ask and ask and ask again about accessibility features just to be sure. Should it be this way? No. But until the world understands, some of the education process belongs to the customer. And then the customer can impress upon hoteliers that he or she will give business only to those places that go to the head of the class.

The details: Cognac has fallen into a bit of a mass-market rut these days. But a few intrepid distillers and blenders are trying to change that, including Nicolas Palazzi, a micro-blender and evangelist for individuality in the brandy world (for more, go to sfg.ly/vcrmmz). A perfect introduction to his work comes in the Paul Marie & Fils Single Barrel Cask Strength Cognac ($130, Bock Vines & Wines), a one-off bottling from the Borderies region commissioned by K&L Wine Merchants.

Louisville is led by Kyle Kuric, a 6-foot-4 forward with hops and range. He scores 13 points a game and will cause a matchup problem for MSU without Branden Dawson. Thornton likely will get the defensive assignment. Wood might get time against Kuric, too. Joining Kuric on the frontline are 6-6 power forward Chane Behanan and Gorgui Dieng, a 6-11 center with similar athleticism to MSU<U+0092>s Adreian Payne. Dieng doesn<U+0092>t quite have the offensive repertoire that Payne does. Louisville will have trouble matching up with Draymond Green. The senior is listed as a power forward but can do anything just about everywhere on the court. Derrick Nix provides low-post scoring and heft when Payne is on the bench. He and Payne teamed up to average 24 points in the first two tournament games.

I don't think the Buffs can win with in-state talent alone; they still need that influx from other areas. However, year after year, we see kids that the Buffs passed on and are playing elsewhere. They must be doing something right. D.J. Davis played (and played well) for Oregon in the National Championship; I don't recall the Buffs giving him a sniff. Hopefully, Coach Embree can at least change some of it. Ditto for Colorado State and Air Force. I would enjoy watching those rosters filled more with local talent. Think of the followings they could have.

Is there any recognition at the absolute highest levels of team ownership/management of two huge sources of future problems ... 1. The Sox have simply been unable to develop an effective farm system under Ken Williams (witness recent Baseball America ratings); and 2. The apparent deficit in organizational talent evaluation that has led to all of the bad trades and free agent signings. Where is the next Al Goldis, who was key to the jackpot of talent the Sox developed in the early '90s (e.g., Thomas, Fernandez, McDowell, Ventura -- even Alvarez through the Himes trade). Now that was a farm system. -- M. Peregrine; Glencoe

Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak replied, “What’s wrong in these critical remarks is the built-in assumption that the governor does not care about the Highlands watershed or conservation of that area of New Jersey. That is just plain wrong. Unfortunately, there’s hardly an interest group or advocacy group that received state funding that didn’t have it cut, in some cases dramatically. These are difficult times — to put it mildly — and all funding will be reassessed and prioritized once our revenues increase, reform is put in place and we stabilize our fiscal position. We will also continue to look closely to determine whether the previous structure and roles of funded organizations were effective and efficient.”

While Sherwood locals won’t see any tax hikes, adding three years to the taxing district does pull money away from things like the state schools fund, which reallocates money back to school districts by per pupil.

The 2010 healthcare reform law gave states until Jan. 1, 2014, to create "exchanges" in which individuals and small businesses could shop for insurance policies. If the states don't, the federal government will operate exchanges for them. The requirement poses a quandary for lawmakers who oppose the federal law: Should they start working on an exchange, or count on the law being repealed by the Supreme Court or by a new Republican-controlled Congress and White House in 2013? The answer is that each state should set up an exchange regardless of how its lawmakers feel about "Obamacare," because it would help ameliorate the very real problems consumers face in the health insurance market.

ABOUT THE CAPITALS: While media and fans scrutinize Hunter's personnel decisions, the players say they support their coach all the way. "To be honest, it's not even something that we notice," said Capitals defenseman Karl Alzner. "We don't go down the sheet at the end of the game and say, 'How much did 'Ovi' play?' You know he wants to play more, and he's frustrated by not playing 20 minutes. But he doesn't care - he wants to win that game." Part of the reason for the diminished ice time is the play of Washington's third and fourth lines, which have performed well in the postseason.

It's a Darwinian view. Having lived nearly all of his 64 years within the patrician bubble, or the bubble of high finance, Romney's idea of the common touch is to debate with his aides whether the pair of jeans he's about to don should be Levis or Gap 1969s. That's pretty funny.
"It was a busy place, a lot of production," Canetti said of the SEDA plant. "We went there with an idea of what models we had in mind. We tested the seats at the stadiums in Germany and saw how they were made in the factory. They have a whole room essentially full with every seat they've made for venues around the world."
No. I'll let others put him in. Bonds was enabled by executives, managers and teammates for most of his career. I'm sure he will find more of the same among the BBWAA electorate, though probably not a 75 percent percentage. It's up to the National Baseball Hall of Fame to change its voting procedure if it wishes to include those who ripped off the game. The tragedy is that Bonds had HOF credentials before using. Of course, others with HOF credentials also sit outside enshrinement. Eventually the Veterans Committee will review the tainted cases. In this instance, allowing some of Bonds' peers to pass judgment seems very appropriate.

Air samplings along the south edge of the property, which is lined by houses, showed methane concentrations of 30 to 40 percent a couple of years ago, Schwarz said. Methane's explosive range is between 5 and 15 percent concentration; heavier than that and there isn't enough oxygen to sustain a fire, but the higher readings were still troubling. However, the most recent readings were "quite low," below 5 percent, and the methane extraction system is "working quite well," he says.

With her impressive height, she can wear them easily.
Following up on a study he co-wrote in the International Journal of Health Care Finance and Economics, he wrote recently in his health-care blog that "for each additional dollar spent by the federal government (taxpayers) on the program since 2003, just $0.14 of it can be attributed to additional value (consumer surplus) to beneficiaries."

But I can't recommend the Vitello Alla Pizziola ($31). Although the veal scallops were sauteed to succulence, the concentrated intensity of tomato, olives and herbs overwhelmed the meat's mild flavor. I'll chalk that up to personal preference, though as a chef I'd reconsider this equation.

Cooking in the center of the country allows us to use apple varieties from either coast. Kitchen experts at Pillsbury (pillsbury.com) call nationally known Braeburn, Empire, Fuji, Gala, Honeycrisp, Newtown Pippin and Pink Lady "good" for baking. Those they list as "excellent" - and probably most often end up in their home as well when baking - are Cameo, Cortland, Golden Delicious, Granny Smith, Idared, Jonagold, Jonathan and, an early favorite of mine, Rome Beauty.

Their level of defensive checking commitment confused and frustrated our players. We wanted the game to be easier, and it wasn't. We lost 4-1 because of it."

Brett Favre has made another move toward leaving the game for good by filing retirement papers with the league, NFL spokesman Greg Aiello confirmed Monday.

1. HOLLIDAY SPENDING: The biggest development for the Cardinals in 2010 was also the biggest contract (so far) in Cardinals history. Matt Holliday agreed to a seven-year, $120-million contract last January that is the richest the franchise has ever completed. A big-money player for the first time in his career, Holliday then went out and had one of the best seasons of any outfielder in the NL. He's the first teammate to have a higher average than Pujols in Pujols' career, and Holliday won the Silver Slugger award. Holliday was the only outfielder in the NL to rank in the top 10 in average, on-best percentage and slugging. The year ends with Holliday making another move. Holliday, embracing the role as a franchise fixture, has brought his family north to call the St. Louis area home.

According to the league, Saints defensive captain Vilma offered $10,000 in cash to any player who knocked then-Cardinals QB Warner out of a playoff game at the end of the 2009 season, and the same amount for knocking then-Vikings QB Favre out of that season<U+0092>s NFC championship game. The Saints were flagged for roughing Favre twice in that game, and the league later said they should have received another penalty for a brutal high-low hit from Remi Ayodele and Bobby McCray that hurt Favre<U+0092>s ankle. He was able to finish the game, but the Saints won in overtime en route to the NFL title.
Dommen orchestrates a gutsy turn with the house-made duck ravioli ($12.50).

Many of the town's older homes, says Murphy, an agent with Bradley Real Estate, are in the downtown neighborhoods of Deer Park and Cascade Canyon. Located on the downtown flats near the lumber company, Fairfax has some vintage homes as well.

The activities kick off May 27 with a festival celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Golden Gate Bridge. The bash, which culminates with a fireworks show, will be held along the 4-mile stretch from Fort Point to Pier 39. Because the event is free, officials say there is no way to gauge how many people might attend. Mary Currie, a bridge spokeswoman, said the expectation is that thousands will participate from all over the country. But the hope is that because the waterfront is spread out, there will be some breathing room.

His rejuvenation has rubbed off on his bandmates. It wasn’t long ago that guitarist Nils Lofgren had both hips replaced; at the Izod Center, he took a long, wild, imaginative solo during "Because the Night" while gyrating and hopping in circles on one leg. Drummer Max Weinberg and bassist Garry Tallent gave the impression that they could play another two and a half hours without dropping a stitch. Charlie Giordano, the accordionist and organist who is filling Federici’s chair, had a particularly strong night, adding vivid color to "The E Street Shuffle" and a soul medley that included the Smokey Robinson-written "The Way You Do the Things You Do" and the Wilson Pickett hit "634-5789."

"Feast of Love" is slim pickings, even though it was adapted from a respected novel by Charles Baxter -- why do I smell a potboiler behind the admiring book reviews? -- was directed by Robert Newman and stars Morgan Freeman, Jane Alexander and Greg Kinnear. The promise of the screen version, set in an Oregon town where everyone knows everyone else's business, is a celebration of love in many forms, enlivened by the celebrants' foibles. What passes for the movie's reality is interlocking episodes of ersatz ecstasy and angst -- a Cupid-governed "Crash" -- plus snippets of wisdom dispensed by Mr. Freeman's character, who serves as the town's coffee-shop philosopher. At one point he tells a love-struck friend, "I think I'd proceed with caution." I'd proceed just as cautiously to the movie.

Priceline remains the best known opaque agency and its "name your price" bidding model is still unique, as far as I know. And a new online site, TheBiddingTraveler (www.thebiddingtraveler.com) has mounted a beta version of an automated system to help you bid. As with Priceline's own entry page, you list destination, date(s), and hotel rating; the site also asks you for a minimum-to-maximum bidding rate range. When you select a district within a big city, the site displays recent winning and losing bids at specific hotels within each range. The site responds with a "recommended lowball offer" and "recommended final offer" rates, based on recent experience. Then, you can either bid manually or the site will automatically bid for you. Other sites that provide information from other travelers about successful bids, unsuccessful bids, and hotel identities include Better Bidding (www.betterbidding.com) and BiddingForTravel (www.biddingfortravel.com). They're always worth a look before you enter an opaque bid or accept an opaque price.

• Huskies ready to face Pac-12's new foes -- Percy Allen, Seattle Times: It's no secret football drove Scott's decision to expand the conference for the first time in three decades, but the league's 0-12 showing against ranked basketball teams magnifies the curious choice to extend invitations to schools that have been weak on the hard court recently. But it's not as if Colorado is embarrassing the Pac-12 this season. The Buffaloes are 9-4 and 1-0 in conference.

How, exactly, does Sizemore plan to compare special-education kids with regular classroom kids?

The most obvious design element of The Bent Brick will be the waiting area, which has a floor-to-ceiling installation made from unfinished 4-by-6 wood blocks surrounded by an irregularly shaped banquette. The wood block idea was inspired by my 7-year-old son, Mack, who was stacking wood in the backyard and doing it wrong. It looked sort of like what you would end up with if you were playing a game of Jenga, kind of airy, more sculptural than structural. And it occurred to me that would be a good idea for the new place. So I took a few photos and showed them to Mark, with the original thought of using actual pieces of firewood. That had a feel that was a little too lodge-y and rustic, so we switched it over to the rough lumber pieces for a more modern feel.
Westfeldt's screenplay reaches for the rat-a-tat-tat of screwball. Occasionally she achieves it, thanks to a gifted cast that includes Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Chris O'Dowd and the filmmaker's real-life partner, Jon Hamm.

Although the urban hustle and bustle remain, an increasingly tense and eerie feeling permeates the air.

"Unquestionably, use of Florida public record laws by the media (in general and not just the interveners here) has become simply a tool to tell a story.

You can’t get anyone at the union to touch the “D” word, either: Decertification is a dirty term, even though labor experts we’ve consulted say that it may be Hunter’s only viable option in the face of management inflexibility — put it in the hands of a judge, and his first instinct is to use the last agreement as a benchmark.

I remember in 2001, when my father took me to see The Yellow Jackets at The Keswick Theater in Glenside, Pa. It was the first concert I had ever attended that wasn't a high school musical, or a gospel festival. And even after seeing performers like Newark's own Naughty by Nature and dozens of other underground bands, I can honestly say that one night at the Keswick left me enthralled in a way that no pop, rock, electronica, R&B or hip-hop performance has since.

We know that innocent people have been convicted of murder in California – three were released in 2011 after serving a total of 57 years – and that innocent people have been executed in other states. Nationwide, 140 inmates from death rows have been exonerated of the crimes for which they were wrongly convicted. In light of possible innocence, using the death penalty puts all Californians at risk of perpetrating the ultimate injustice of executing an innocent person, for when the governor gives the final order to execute, he does so in the name of California residents, and the death certificate will read, "Homicide," as the cause of death.

Derrick Rose’s health. Actually, this absurd leg-dragging 2011-12 season was mostly around Derrick Rose’s health – you knew that if he was MVP-worthy again, the Bulls were formidable and frightening. But since he is not, they are vulnerable — just not in this round. Chicago went 18-9 without him this year.
We'll win because: Youth Never Dies takes the listener speeding through pop punk riffs, sliding through melodic breakdowns and crashing into a blast of heavy metal, delivering a unique sound appealing to many different genres of music. Guitarist Jim Scully and bassist Connor Peterson have participated in the Rock-Off the past two years, giving the band an edge in experience. With Sullivan's glass-shattering vocals, Scully's thrashing guitar riffs, Peterson's melodic bass lines and Mackson's pulse-pounding drum beats, the band shows they have what it takes to win.

The governors' cooperation hasn't produced a headline-grabbing accord such as the one between O'Malley and McDonnell's predecessor, Democratic Gov. Tim Kaine. Those two stood side-by-side on the banks of the Potomac River in 2008 to announce a ban on harvesting blue crabs in winter months, a development that is credited with a rebound in the population.
Leighton's decision to hold the union in contempt followed lengthy testimony about what happened during the protests and the raid. Security guard Charlie Cadwell, employed by Columbia Security for patrols at the Longview grain terminal for the past two months, told the judge of the harrowing experience: Every protester he saw that night was carrying a weapon -- baseball bats, lead pipes, garden tools.
"It would be undeniable that they were targeted for criticism and undermined by Dr. McCollom," assistant Prosecutor Barbara Marburger wrote in a memo to commissioners last March. "Since Dr. McCollom has supervisory responsibilities, since she reportedly engaged in ethnically charged comments, and since Dr. Miller failed to take appropriate action concerning Dr. McCollom's activities, a fact-finder could conclude that illegal retaliation ... played a part."

Steelhead (and salmon in the fall) can only ascend 11 miles of the Au Sable before they run into Foote Dam, but those 11 miles can be very productive because the spawning gravel and resting lies are very obvious to experienced anglers fishing from drift boats or kayaks.
An exhausted sense of camaraderie in the face of perceived indifference by airport officials had set in among the stranded. People shared phone chargers, made coffee runs, commiserated over convenience store meals and minded luggage during bathroom breaks.

What hasn't been lost are the impressive dynamic qualities that the G37 - and before it the G35 - has had for years. It's why the G should be on your must-drive list if you're shopping for a luxury sedan that's engaging to drive. There's that connection to the road when you're in the driver's seat that's difficult for automakers to create, but which is instantly recognizable. A combination of minimal body roll, a rear-wheel-drive platform, and nicely weighted, responsive steering deserve much of the credit. Even with all-wheel drive, the G25x retains the feel of a rear-drive sedan.
TRENTON — Republicans are shaking up their ticket in one of the most hotly contested legislative races in the state.

Going back many decades, the volunteers have taken this responsibility very seriously, keeping up with the increasingly detailed regimen of medical training that has evolved for emergency medical crews over the years.
MINIMIZE SHOPPING. Before you buy anything, apply the "six-month rule" I previously posted. Ask yourself, "If I buy this, where will it be in six months: in use or put aside on a shelf somewhere?" All too often, something that looked "cute" on vacation becomes a white elephant once you get home.

ORLANDO, FLA. — Taking your older teenagers to Orlando for spring break might seem like an odd choice — aren't they a little old for Disney? Yes, our 16- and 18-year-olds are a bit jaded for Mickey Mouse, but we saw a last-minute trip to Orlando as a chance to hold our kids hostage for some family fun.

øTAKIN' IT EASY: For their first-ever Fest appearance, country-rock titans the Eagles opened with a near-a capella version of Seven Bridges Road to send the message that their gorgeous harmonizing voices were still intact as they entered their fifth decade of performing. Then a countrified guitar line arose during the intro to How Long and it was clear the instrumental chops were still functioning as well. The group followed that opening with two hours of hits from their vast catalog, most done in arrangements familiar to the fans. A Spanish-inflected trumpet solo led into Hotel California, but that was about as out-of-the-box as it got. Early highlights included Peaceful Easy Feeling, I Can't Tell You Why and Witchy Woman, and they closed the show with an encore of their first hit, Take It Easy.

Wendell Maxey: You can always count on Armon for two things: to be real with you and be ready to shoot when he gets in the game. Can't blame the guy for having a quick trigger with the mop up minutes he played for Nate McMillan to close out the season. Going forward, I think you bring Armon back. He's a good size guard with an aggressive drive for the game. The smooth lefty showed some growth signs during his stint with the Idaho Stampede and is still learning how to run a team and play the right way (read: cut down on the turnovers youngster). Besides, you have to bring Johnson back. Who else is going to come running and cheering off the bench with Patty Mills?
I would like to share a creative way my high school alma mater solved this problem. Justin-Siena High School, in Napa, California, was founded in 1966. The city of Napa has a history of naming its school mascots these sorts of names: Napa High School Indians, Napa College Chieftains, Redwood Jr. High School Warriors. Justin-Siena chose the Braves.

Blake Smith, a Marine captain and helicopter pilot, may be the most complicated - wry, blunt, driven but lost. During a night-time, mid-air collision while escorting Army Rangers to a raid, he was thrown from his chopper while those inside crashed and burned. What wasn't amputated from his body was pieced back together with hardware. But his greatest burden is that others blame him for the accident.

The Ohio Senate first passed Senate Bill 17. Then the Ohio House approved a similar bill, House Bill 45. According to House Speaker William G. Batchelder, a Medina Republican, lawmakers were expected to move one of the bills this past week but that didn't happen. Lawmakers apparently are working on a compromise, trying to settle on one bill to forward to the governor.

But McKinley did not need to have its entire roof replaced or to undergo a complete, and expensive, seismic upgrade. All six Portland schools to be renovated will need such treatment, Sylvester said.

Now, Oregon will tell you that it believes it has the greatest talent pool around. But the Ducks -- who haven't had a first-round selection since Jonathan Stewart in 2008 -- don't. And what we've learned in the past three seasons by watching the success on the field fail to translate into high-caliber NFL picks is that Kelly doesn't need all the best players to win big. He doesn't even need a half dozen of them. He just needs some pretty good football players, and maybe, a small number of guys who have a chance to play in the NFL someday.
At the river, Mister Bob watches Kody Houston, 19, climb a ladder to the tree house deck and grab a thick rope.

Those whom I have interviewed have started scholarship funds in a lost loved one's memory in order to make meaning of their loss. They lean on spiritual beliefs for support. They hold annual rituals like candle lighting at significant dates, such as birthdays, to keep the missing person present in their lives. They give lectures about dealing with loss. They participate in focus groups with other people dealing with loss. Sometimes they make profound life changes, like Phylicia's half-brother, who decided to become a Baltimore police officer in response to her disappearance.

But that's about all the Heat had going as Chicago simply throttled Miami in a 103-82 win.

The Makena Beach and Golf Resort's relaunch includes an expanded, state-of-the-art fitness center; new activities such as stargazing with iPads and cycling on complimentary Schwinns; and perhaps most important to guests who remember the hotel's faded glory, upgrades to its 310 renovated rooms and suites. Up the coast, the Sheraton Maui Resort & Spa has completed a $6.5 million enhancement of its 508 rooms, featuring new Hawaiian artwork, tropical furnishings and - Web surfers, rejoice - Wi-Fi.

"As part of our long-standing security protocol, the EPU provides secure, protected travel by vehicle in the overwhelming majority of the Governor’s business and personal travel, except in those rare instances when the Governor’s schedule warrants use of air travel."
Easy on the ears. Power tools are noisy, and too much blasting from a loud motor isn't healthy at any age. Give some high-quality headphones that will block noise and protect hearing in loud workshops and when power tools are in use. Save some green by choosing a speakerless set -- not designed for listening to music; they only block sound. Example: Direct Sound HP-25 speakerless headphones sell for around $40. And look for built-in sound control in the tools you select. Example: The engine, fan housing and exhaust tube on Husqvarna's 356B T backpack blower for large yards is insulated to dampen noise, which is good for the operator and for the neighbors.

The Bearcats, who had six players post scores in the 60s or 70s last year, won the 11-team American Midwest Conference/Dakota Athletic Conference tournament and qualified for the NAIA championships last spring. Five seniors from the 2010-11 roster are graduating.

If you're in the market for fresh locally grown produce, ask questions before you buy. Some markets are for farmers only, and some include distributors, who may have "picked" the fruits and vegetables from a wholesaler. Farmers markets are also a good source of locally produced cheese, eggs, honey, meat and baked goods. It's best to arrive around opening time for hard-to-find produce.

Late-night Portland offers a dizzying array of liquid choices. I began at the Horse Brass Pub, a traditional British bar with walls of dartboards and dozens of beers on tap, and a mixed clientele of pale old-timers in tam caps and young outdoorsy types doing chin-ups on ceiling beams. I moved upscale at the Teardrop Lounge with its $12 exotic cocktails, and bitters dispensed via a mad scientist's collection of eye-droppers and baroque mixing cups.

With the exception of Christie’s refusal to sign a tax increase on millionaires, the self-proclaimed conservative has drawn few ideological lines. Instead he has proposed what he brands “common-sense” solutions designed to appeal to taxpayers — like public employee pension and benefit reforms, a cap on annual property tax increases and a limit on school superintendent salaries.
Sightlines in the stadium and proximity to the field will be a priority. One of the Metrodome's endearing qualities is the noise level that the fans generate, ear-splitting volume that gives the Vikings one of the better home-field advantages in the league. The Wilfs want to recreate that atmosphere as much as possible.
It's not clear who built the bomb, but, because of its sophistication and its similarity to the Christmas bomb, authorities suspected it was the work of master bomb maker Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri.

Is it OK to buy that organic peach in January if it comes from Chile, or is the fuel used to transport it too costly to the planet? What about the lives of the animals killed for food? Or those of the people who work in slaughterhouses or pick strawberries? When words like "sustainable" are marketing tools, how can a consumer figure out what to do? And can a family on a budget afford to eat sustainably?

Darker, too. DiNizio’s lyrics were real-world, grown-up stuff; sometimes frighteningly so.

The great room, whose own entry is framed by darkly stained redwood, hand-carved into a gently curving arch, almost like the hint of an embrace, has a high, beamed ceiling, making the room feel larger than its actual dimensions. The great room also has a large picture window, providing expansive views of a nearby golf course. No heavy draperies here. Instead, Judy retained the original curtain rod of triangular banners, some with a fleur-de-lis design, and reminiscent of the banners one would expect at a castle. The banners' triangular motif is repeated behind the oversize hutch in the couple's dining room.

FEMA announced in 2007 that it would reclassify most of the flood plain as high-risk because the Army Corps of Engineers would not certify that the levees would withstand a 100-year flood, although they were designed to protect against a 500-year flood. The map changes would mean new restrictions on development and force many business and home owners to buy costly flood insurance.
"That's 3,000 students who are actively involved in downtown Portland, who are probably working in downtown Portland, who are then attending school events, attending guest lectures or going to sporting events, they're involved in campus activities," Markey said.

He and Midway Ford owner Ed Tichenor were among area dealers who picked up their first new Ranger models at a big event Ford held at the Mall of America in October 1992.
But his impact on the court was non-existent. From a wins and losses standpoint, it doesn't matter if he returns. If he's on the roster there needs to be at least one -- if not two -- better centers in front of him. Otherwise, you're playing 4-on-5 on offense and 4.5-on-5 on defense too often.
ø"Just when you think you've got it figured out, you come to some place like Richmond, and it's all new business," Dodge/SRT Motorsports Engineering's Howard Comstock said.

What's the common link? 1) Less money for public schools. 2) More drilling off Florida's coast. 3) A ban on gay adoptions. These are all things most Floridians oppose — and things supported by the man they just elected governor.
An even more recent addition to the Istanbul scene is the Sabanci Museum. I was hard put to decide which was the more impressive, the stunning location on a hilltop overlooking the Bosphorus Straits or the impressive collection donated by the Sabanci family, last owners of the mansion. That collection includes paintings, sculpture and an Ottoman calligraphy exhibit that spans five centuries.
Come Wednesday's season opener against the Miami Marlins, Matheny realizes there no longer will be an endless bench that can be replenished with backfield talent.

And this is the team that gets selected to play in the Sugar Bowl? This is where the system is flawed—and where the BCS administrators have no pretenses (sound familiar?) about the goal for every BCS bowl game outside the national title game: sell tickets, stimulate the economy, television ratings (in that order).
"At one level it's very unfortunate for David Cameron, the timing of all of this," said Steven Fielding, director of the Center for British Politics at the University of Nottingham. "This could have happened at any point in the last 10 years, that the prime minister of the day could get caught in a close embrace with Rupert Murdoch — they've all been in a close embrace with Rupert Murdoch."

Personally I don't worry about competing with the larger regional banks because they, as publicly traded banks, they have other constituents.

After beating Georgetown in the second-to-last week of the season, Seton Hall seemingly had stamped its ticket to the NCAAs. With two remaining layup games — home against Rutgers and at last-place DePaul — who wouldn’t think that?

Not to miss: Sure, there are crab cakes and salads, chicken and lamb, but that's not why you came. RingSide remains one of the most consistent special-occasion spots in the city, with 14-ounce steaks, tuxedoed service and a multimillion dollar wine list. The just-finished remodel kept the low-lit charm of the 67-year-old steakhouse while adding a touch of polish and class (tip: ask to sit in the new Barrel Room).

Langella, to dredge up anecdotes that practically stretch back to Pola Negri, he kept a diary? “No. Absolutely not. I’ve never made one single note. And I don’t like computers. I wrote this longhand. Took a year from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.” How could he reprise so many memories? “Please. I’m an actor. That’s what I do. I memorize. I store things in my head. Total recall. If I saw you 10 years from now, I could recount everything you wore tonight.”

It might be useful to take a step back in understanding that the site of the Battle of Princeton counterattack was envisioned from the beginning to be a vital part of Princeton Battlefield State Park. In 1944, C.S. Sincerbeaux prepared a map showing Washington’s counterattack on what is now the proposed faculty housing site. This map became the basis for Gov. Walter Edge’s park boundary lines. The Institute for Advanced Study received a copy of the map and indicated that it was favorably disposed to working with the governor in putting the park together. Then, in 1945, the institute purchased 129.99 acres from Robert Maxwell, including the site of the counterattack — a site that Gov. Edge passionately wanted to be in the park. In 1947, Mr. Maxell and Mrs. Agnes Pyne Hudson both gave property to the park; other parcels were purchased, some acquired under the threat of eminent domain.
Debates have turned facile superiority into an art form. The charade of engagement is so popular with the candidates because they can deflect any question that pushes their feet toward the fire. On the one occasion that moderator Tracy Barry invited follow-up -- "It's just getting interesting," she said, on the argument over the long-term support Bonamici and her husband, Michael Simon, had for David Wu -- no one grabbed the mike.

We all know that reality television is that often more in name than in fact. Reports have long surfaced about "missed" scenes re-shot for the cameras or scenarios set up for the benefit of the audience. At this point, it is unknown just how much of that goes on in this particular show. But as with the old scientific maxim - the very act of observing something changes it - so too do I wonder if the very act of observing these kids' lives has changed them. They certainly seem busier than my family.

It seems as if it would be the culmination of Meyer's dreams, too. A lifelong Ohio State fan, he grew up with a framed portrait of Woody Hayes hanging on the wall at his family house. He was a graduate assistant at Ohio State in 1986-87, working for Earle Bruce. He even wore No. 45 at St. John High School in Ashtabula in honor of Archie Griffin, his favorite player.

Swanson said the sales drop last year all happened at the city's store at 149th Street and Cedar Avenue, located at the heart of a reconstruction project for rapid bus transit. Increased sales at the city's other two stores helped offset about $200,000 in lost sales at the Cedar store, he noted.

Arrange by size and shape.
I always document what has happened, get names, try to make the best of the situation short term and not upend my vacation by stewing over the incident. Then when I am home, I contact the travel company, lay out the details and ask for a specific remedy – usually a refund and a credit for a free equivalent booking in the future. Sometimes I get it, sometimes I don't.

"I've always said you find out what kind of football team you had in April," Muschamp said last week.
Not everything is high end, though. Pastas start at $18 for the penne with eggplant and asparagus. The house-made veal ravioli special with truffle sauce, flavorful but light as an air kiss, went for $22. Chicken Fiorentino, a menu regular for the same price, comes in a generous portion but lacks excitement despite the presence of lump crab meat and spinach, as well as a chardonnay sauce. More definition would make it memorable. Along those lines, the grilled quail special ($26) stuffed with figs and Gorgonzola offered a savvy statement over wild mushroom risotto.
"There's only one little line in the book about how most of the people froze to death. They did not drown," Denenberg said. "Hypothermia is a much longer death. I had to make a decision about what's accurate and what's ghoulish."

After learning that Ryan Seacrest's girlfriend said "yummy" while looking at Phillips, Hollie sang us home with Miley Cyrus' "The Climb," which brought in a standing ovation from the judges and may have been enough to keep her dark-horse dreams alive. Imagine what Celine Dion would sound like with a little bit of soul. And then throw in the fact that it's a Miley Cyrus ode to self-determination. It was, as the judges said, stepping it up.

Detroit has played Phoenix in the first round and been eliminated by San Jose in the second round the past two seasons.

The VO Group representatives also got timeshare owners to send the VO Group money purportedly to have timeshares cancelled or sold. After receipt of payments for the VO Group’s “service,” the conspirators caused those payments to be deposited into a bank account in the name of the VO Group.

So let me get this straight: with a new coaching staff coming in, and with so much work to do in planning and learning, does it make sense for the Rams to install not one, but two new and completely different offenses between now and September?
But now that Hall of Fame business will be tough sledding. As the central character in the Mitchell Report and with Clemens' trainer Brian McNamee and Pettitte both providing enough evidence to confirm it, we all know he is a drug cheat and that will likely keep him, Bonds, Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and all the other big names of the Steroid Era out of Cooperstown.

The presence of three to eight fetuses, of course, does not have to result in the birth of three to seven children. Thanks to a procedure called multifetal reduction, parents have the ability to reduce the number of fetuses and therefore limit the risks to the mother and the remaining babies. It is obviously a difficult and painful decision for prospective parents, but the bottom line is that multifetal reduction can vastly reduce the chances of an extremely premature birth and other complications.

Santa Barbara was once known as a “city of books,” where a page-turning tourist could spend days prowling the stacks of small and large stores. The massive Earthling Bookstore was the progenitor of the bookstore-as-meeting place style later embraced by the chains.

Somehow the worst was avoided this time. Eschewing the public grandstanding that has long prompted the Chinese to dig in their heels, U.S. officials worked behind the scenes to first secure a deal that saw Chen leave the embassy on Wednesday to be reunited with his family and receive hospital care. Clinton avoided shaming China publicly. She issued one written statement but said nothing else.

The lemon meringue pie suffered from a clumpy filling.

Mind Trust: Proposes free preschool for all 4-year-olds living within IPS' boundaries.
Under this “tiered” system, the paradigm is development as opposed to exclusivity – something I much prefer. There is a lot of benefit to making NXT the first stop, Smackdown the land of opportunity and Raw (to steal a phrase from WCW) “where the big boys play.” Most importantly, this system doesn't require a draft ... not in the traditional WWE definition we are used to anyway. Instead of trades, why not a sports-style draft where shows like NXT and Smackdown get populated with new faces, complete with scouting reports and flashy video packages that educate us on why we should care about this individual?
Unknown third parties, the outsiders who may provide players with money or other benefits in violation of NCAA rules, have been what always scared Ohio State, and most major programs, more than anything else.

And then there's clutching your throat.
After intermission the orchestra performed the Symphony No. 2 by Jean Sibelius. This popular symphony is deceptive. It requires a particular kind of mental virtuosity from a conductor because the work is built from discontinuities. Gerard Schwarz made the edges of the fragments sharp by observing strict silences and by not taking time between musical gestures. The layered expression of these broken fragments in the development, and their simultaneous combination during the recapitulation were balanced with great care and they made an impressive impact.

The No. 2 receiver job is wide open, and the Jets could look to the draft to find their guy. The team is financially invested in top receiver Santonio Holmes, and Jeremy Kerley, a fifth-round pick last year, showed promise as a slot receiver last year. But a young, tall, fast receiver to pair opposite Holmes could be a difference-maker, even in a run-first offense. If Notre Dame’s Michael Floyd lasts until the 16th pick, he could be a great option. But senior personnel consultant Terry Bradway also expects receiver talent late in the draft, and the Jets have shown interest in a handful of guys (Georgia Tech’s Stephen Hill, Wake Forest’s Chris Givens, Northwestern’s Jeremy Ebert) who could be available later.

Its old-style brewing technique does not involve the usual, giant vertical cylinders you see in brewpubs, but rather a more open process.

Bad omen: A bipartisan decision by the Senate ethics committee to hire an outside counsel to investigate Nevada's John Ensign will only increase GOP pressure on him to step aside in 2012. Ensign, who once fancied himself as White House material, points out that the Justice Department declined to indict him, but that's not stopping his own colleagues, who hadn't brought in an outside ethics help in more than 20 years.

His poll numbers back home have cratered and GOP recruiters wish he'd go away and give Rep. Dean Heller a clear shot at the nomination (though after 2010, the establishment might not be able to get anyone a clear shot). Democrats see Nevada as one of their few chances to add a Senate seat in 2012 and are pushing Rep. Shelly Berkley to make the race.

You can bake stuffing separately in a casserole dish - many cooks prefer it - but remember that it will not take as long to cook as the turkey.

There are obvious reasons to criticize the Dolans and the Indians: drafting, talent evaluation, drafting, player development in some cases and -- most of all -- drafting.

"What we do as a staff is we have a lot of clarity with everything we talk about," Hoke said. "How we want to approach the academics, how we want to approach socially with each other, then the football part. The opportunity these guys have from an educational standpoint ... they've got tutors and advisers. (Still), every day, we've got to talk to our guys, positionally or whatever else, to remind them why they're here. That's a big part of it."

The players have said all the right things in welcoming Marshall into the mix, but that's because the perception is that this is a clean slate for the troubled receiver.

Though I'm a deep-fried turkey fan and couldn't find a recipe, I wasn't eager to risk disfigurement from lowering an enormous bird into a vat of boiling oil - if I could even find a big enough vat - so I nixed that idea. Short of a wild, last-ditch veer into turkey tartare territory - inspired by Ippuku's chicken tartare, which Michael Bauer quite liked on his visit last year - my mind drew a blank.

These entrepreneurs are part of what Portland State University professor Charles Heying describes as the "artisan economy," a movement capitalizing on growing consumer demand for local and unique products -- demand couched in part as a rejection of national chains and globalization.

Imagine what you and I could do with one day in which we didn't have to bind ourselves to a numbered date, one day with no prescribed obligations, no appointments, no work, no boss, no meetings, no mail, no media programming. That day would be a get-out-of-jail-free card, a day with a blank slate, a day of unordered possibilities, a day wiped clean.
Yet tolls have gone up, and our governor still wants more — to extend the current 6 percent sales tax to gasoline and perhaps to add another 1 percent hike in the sales tax (which he raised 1 percent just four years ago). All this is said to be necessary so that we can meet transportation needs for bridges and roads. Oh, and Gov. Martin O'Malleyalso wants to increase the flush tax to save the Chesapeake Bay, a cause that has become a black hole for money pouring into Annapolis without much of a demonstrable result.

Hotel Nipton, 107355 Nipton Road, Nipton; (760) 856-2335, http://www.nipton.com. A hands-down classic. It's as if the fickle motel gods gathered up all the charm and character that was never put into the chain establishments on I-15 and gifted it all to Nipton. Guests can choose rooms in the hotel (with shared bathrooms and a wood-stove-warmed common area) for $79, including tax and continental breakfast, or eco-tents that stand in the open desert (eco-tents are only intermittently available). There's also a restaurant, with a similarly erratic schedule, so call to make sure there'll be a meal for you.

This isn't about having a bunch of bad guys in office who are incapable of doing the right thing by us. I suspect a good many are not only capable, but have the best of intentions. Certainly the pressures of a downturned economy haven't helped slow the desire for a development juggernaut to race through our county. It puts them in a tough spot. But we want to be smart about how we grow and an unwillingness to consider dissenting voices isn't smart.
Even the Ga. 400 MARTA extension doesn't sway Aubrey Brooks of Roswell, a 21-year-old manager of a men's hat store at Cumberland Mall. "Extending the rail line wouldn't matter," not enough to raise taxes, he said.

A: You know, you pause (laughs). And you sort of gather your breath and you walk into the scene, for sure. But once again, I knew that it's there for a reason.

Hey, Hoynsie: Last week a man claiming to be Kevin Kouzmanoff's friend said he didn't sign with the Indians because they wouldn't offer him incentives. If he's right, why would the Indians not offer incentives? If he doesn't make them, it doesn't cost any money. If he does, I would assume they would be worth paying for. -- Tom Goodsite, Kirksville, Mo.

Now that President Barack Obama has kept his promise to withdraw all troops by the end of year, which is what so many of us have been looking for, there is this very vocal minority who are against leaving.

Baxter did get fined $5,000 and was placed on probation until Dec. 31, but that's essentially a wrist slap. Imagine the fines and repercussions if this were any other sport.

Go ahead and give Howard exactly what he wants as this Dwightmare of a season spins toward its dysfunctional, farcical conclusion. Let's face it, Dwight is already the new CEO of the team and the de facto general manager, so why not make him player-coach as well?
“If you were going in for major surgery, you would want to make sure the surgeon has done this procedure many times before trying it out on you,” Power said. “Financial advice, when dealing with millions of dollars, would be no different.”

At Westview High School, where class sizes are already 35 to 40 students in many courses, principal Mike Chamberlain said he has no regrets about past decisions.
Instead, an English-only bill is touted as the quickest way to help immigrants succeed. If that is the case why aren't the same good intentions a ringing endorsement of the Maryland Dream Act? Why wait and hope to see if any of these shiftless immigrants will wise up and learn English in Anne Arundel County out of brute necessity when the students who could benefit from the Dream Act have already demonstrated enough English proficiency and good conduct (i.e. paying taxes and applying for citizenship) in order to justify receiving a modest college tuition break?

Whether Jennings reacted to the situation appropriately depends on who's doing the talking.
LA: I have one more question for you. You describe a society in which people look after themselves because they know the most about themselves, and they will flourish if you let them. You, however, are a crusader for the rights of others. For example, you say in "Free to Choose" – and it's a very powerful statement – a tiny minority is what matters. So is it one of the weaknesses of the free market that it requires certain extremely talented and disinterested people who can defend it?
I walked to the northern edge and, while there had been rain earlier in the day, it was now clear, and I could make out the massive cliffs of Gozo's southern coastline, and even Fort Chambray at Mgarr Harbour. I saw the ferry, too, heading that way from Malta, surely carrying travelers departing the well-beaten path.
Burgerville, the Vancouver-based chain, is well-known for its commitment to local ingredients. But Burgerville isn't alone.
What about employees at religiously affiliated homeless shelters, thrift stores and food pantries? Are they ministering to the poor? If so, may they be discriminated against?

Theories on how our system grew so insular: First, Kitzhaber was right. Given the state's initiative system, the city's commission structure and the ideological divide between Multnomah County and almost everywhere else, this place does tend toward ungovernable.
Two albums were quickly put out by his company, "The Monkees" and "More of the Monkees," and "both went to number one, outselling the Beatles albums of the same period. We were on a roll."

MH: Books about the Templars fall into two categories. Some are strictly history and confine themselves to the two centuries of the Templars' existence. Others are speculative and deal in the many stories surrounding the Templars, in what you might call the afterlife of the Templars that continues in the popular imagination to this day. I wanted to take a serious look at both the history and the mythic afterlife and to show how they are intimately related and always have been -- how the Templars became the subject of popular imagination already at their inception, celebrities, you might say, the superstars of the Middle Ages.
Anyone tuned into a television or weather service last week would have been hard pressed to miss the news that dangerous storms were brewing in the Midwest.
<U+200B>The aroma of roasting meat turning on rotisseries is bound to make you hungry, and this place is good for filling up while spending little. Ribs come by the full rack; chickens come whole. Best values are family dinners serving four: churrascada (combo of meat Brazilian-style) or parrilhada (Portuguese-style). The rear dining room looks like a homey kitchen. – Brooke Tarabour

PLANTING: My Stropharia always produced best in sun or broken shade with well-drained, moist soil. Mushroom mycelium needs to be mixed with fresh hardwood chips or sawdust. Do not use chips or sawdust from pine, cedar, redwood, eucalyptus, juniper or other fragrant woods. Fresh straw, NOT hay, can also be used, though it doesn't last as long as wood chips.
The PIIGS, an acronym for the struggling nations of Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain, dominated the headlines a year ago when Greece was going through its financial crisis.

Flash forward 21 years, and Penman, now 37, is a longtime lynch pin of the SFJazz Collective, the all-star group that performs this weekend at Yoshi's-Oakland. And here's the point of the story: The Collective, in addition to performing its eight members' own originals, is focusing this year (as it did last year) on their arrangements of tunes by a particular "classic" composer: Stevie Wonder.

"Let them sit in a paddy wagon for three hours and miss all the fun. Embarrass them in front of all their friends. Sometimes, that's all you need to do," he said.
Questionable Calls: Kendricks was a worthy pick, but his short stature may not be ideal to playing as a SAM linebacker that often has to cover much taller tight ends. Foles had been sliding down draft boards and may have been still available on the third day, while the Eagles didn't bring in an understudy to heavily worked running back LeSean McCoy until taking the underachieving Brown near the end of the event.
After being with her and her family for awhile, they suggested that the two of us go to Municipal Stadium to see the doubleheader between the Tigers and the Indians. Looking back, maybe her parents had already made decisions about my involvement with their family -- get him out of the house.

Zane, an Oahu native and third-generation Chinese American, moved to Hilo in the mid-'70s to study Hawaiian culture, deepening his understanding of the traditional uses for the islands' unique flora. He also studied hula and eventually married Nalani Kanaka'ole, whose family is practically synonymous with the art form: The Edith Kanaka'ole Stadium in Hilo, named after her mother, hosts the islands' most prestigious hula competition, the annual Merrie Monarch Festival.
With that said, the two do have an opportunity to bring a city title back to South Bronx, the goal the two had as freshmen. The schedule does get tougher as the Phoenix meet undefeated Bronx B North foe Bronx Science twice next week and still face the other top teams in the division, like InTech and Stevenson.
The one piece of his itinerary that has gotten the most attention is the visit planned for Iowa in two weeks. The Hawkeye State has the first caucus of the presidential primary season and some suggest the trip proves Christie wants to position himself to lead a national ticket in 2012, when President Obama would be up for re-election.
Perhaps the team's biggest stumbling block isn't youth or talent or work ethic but lack of experience. None of the players or coaches has competed at the highest level.
My husband and I are now struggling because we're not sure how God really views gays and lesbians. To listen to some religious people, my son will go to hell. I can't believe that God would create a person to be this way, then turn His back on him.

President Obama has pledged to begin the withdrawal of American troops in July 2011 and to complete the transition to Afghan-led forces by the end of 2014. Most observers predict that the first troop reduction will be little more than a token gesture. That moves the debate to whether maintaining a major troop presence in Afghanistan for an additional two and a half years can achieve our stated goals and, even if it can, whether it is worth the additional cost in American lives and treasure.
Christie said he understands each town values its unique character, but pointed to Princeton Township and Princeton Borough’s recent decision to consolidate. The state will pick up the transition costs for the first year to encourage more towns to merge. “If you wonder why your property taxes are so high,” he said, “the next culprit after school funding is this proliferation of repetition, everybody having a CFO, everybody having a business administrator.”

It might be bearable if (as in “Knight and Day”) there were even a fleeting moment of wit. Or if (as in “The Losers”) the picture accepted its own witlessness and even indulged it with a bit of camp or amusingly over-the-top action.
The Fillmore The restaurant at the back of the hall is quieter than the front of the venue, making it especially nice for parents who've brought their kids to the show, but aren't interested in watching the bands. (Just try to ignore the kids canoodling on the bar stools around the room.)
The Stoops brothers and Pelini are all from the Youngstown area, but they already have jobs. Gruden was considered briefly when Tressel got the job, and has shown no great interest in returning to the sideline, particularly at the college level.

When he returned to the restaurant in mid-August, he was told he was no longer welcome, even though he had been a regular customer for years. Rahr then sent the restaurant's manager a letter voicing his dismay.
This is the part where you would say, "Hilarity ensues," but it doesn't. Instead, the trio get involved in a ludicrous murder plot cooked up by a woman named Lydia (Sofia Vergara) that will somehow lead back to the main plot; astounding coincidence is a common device in the movie. Which can be fine if it's used to good comedic effect. Here, it just seems lazy. By the time Moe joins the cast of "Jersey Shore," you're likely to have long since given up caring.

About 750 employees must be reclassified, Kohlstrand said.
After dinner came a gradual winding down, generally with a recounting of the day's experiences - rubbing noses with a sea lion, a peaceful swim in a turquoise bay, an iPhone video of dolphins bow-riding - and, for some, star-gazing, cocktails and the subsequent philosophizing that often follows.
Although a tough stance on the topic tends to sit well with Republican voters, giving candidates a potential boost in the primaries, it could come back to haunt them in the general election, according to some political strategists.
"You just got pumped three-nil in the first half," Portland coach John Spencer said. "Of course it's a disappointment."

On the other hand, Joe Grier, who trains Foreman, says they would welcome that kind of pressure. “We need to cut him with accurate punching, confuse him with movement and dominate the geography of the ring. We need to make him bleed, frustrate him, make him over-commit. When he does, Yuri will win that chess match.”

"Even a three-month delay can cause harm to investors," Hardy said.
The course Romney advocated differed greatly from the one that was ultimately taken. GM and Chrysler went into bankruptcy on the strength of a massive bailout that Romney opposed. Neither Republican President George W. Bush nor Democratic President Barack Obama believed the automakers would have survived without that backup from taxpayers.

"I've seen the evolution," said Jeff Dean, a backcountry ski patrol expert who has worked in the ski and snowboard industry for 19 years. "There's a lot of hype now. They look at these guys jumping off cliffs, that radical stuff they're doing in the movies, all the jumps, terrain, 20-foot air, and they want to do it. That's the way it's going. I've done it too, even in the trees. I broke a rib."
"These are the designers of the future," says Stephanie Solomon, fashion director of Bloomingdale's. "When you think of the old guard, of Karl Lagerfeld, Giorgio Armani and Ralph Lauren, as much as I respect them, they are not spring chickens anymore. These designers are going to usurp them.

At age 14 and weighing about 175 pounds in the summer between eighth grade and his freshman year of high school, the home-schooled Tebow did 315 curl reps of a 55-pound bar. It's not an exaggeration to say the lactic acid buildup would not allow him to straighten his arms for three days.

Except in a day when "bad boys" are celebrated and the media gravitate toward scuttlebutt and salacious scandal, like flies to poop, a clean-cut young man reared by missionary parents in the fear and admonition of the Lord is ridiculed for being "too good," reviled even, mocked. All of which to me amounts to a kind of religious bigotry.

The pretty Hampshire village is where Austen was born in the rectory of her father's church in 1775. Like many places that have an early connection with a famous person's life, Steventon has less to offer the fan than hoped. It was the incubator of Austen's talents, but her literary life really started after she left town. The 13th century St. Nicholas church where her father was vicar still stands, though the rectory was torn down in 1828. The church bells are a 1995 gift from the Jane Austen Society of North America. Life in the small village shaped her country-centric attitudes. The Vyne, a great house in nearby Basingstoke that is now maintained by the National Trust, was the scene of the kind of parties that populate her books. Austen's father's decision to retire from the church and move in 1801 to the busy, expensive city of Bath came as culture shock to Austen, then 26. In what may be an apocryphally melodramatic story, Jane is said to have fainted dead away when her father broke what he thought was the happy news.

But when the game beckoned for a hero, it was the rookie point guard who always answered the Bat Signal. Statistical gurus will use numbers to say Irving was among the league's most clutch players.

The owners of 98,000 homes in Baltimore receive at least some benefit from the homestead credit this year. The remaining 25,000 get nothing, either because their home values have plummeted or, like Burdick, they bought within the past few years and have had no increases to cap. Renters are also on the losing end of the homestead equation — landlords aren't eligible for the break and pass the cost of their higher tax bills on to their tenants.

Can you explain why the Bears refuse to give D.J. Moore a chance to play on the outside? It can't be because of his height since he's actually taller than Tim Jennings, the incumbent opposite Peanut. And I can't imagine that Jennings is much faster than Moore, if at all. Plus, D.J. is a much bigger playmaker than Jennings, who drops many more potential interceptions than he holds on to. I'm afraid that Moore might leave when he becomes a free agent because Lovie won't let him spread his wings as a legit outside corner and not just a nickelback. Reggie Carolina, St. Paul, Minn.

After trailing Portland 74-68 with 5:12 left, the Lakers closed the game on a 16-6 run, and hit their final five shots of the game. Kobe was Kobe, and the Laker defense was smothering.

The city-owned H.L. Mencken House suffers from more than 15 years of benign neglect. While unoccupied and unwatched, termites attacked the under flooring on the main level. This destruction has been abated. Additionally, the air-conditioning units malfunctioned, causing severe water damage to the interior walls and buckling to the hardwood floors. For better than a decade, the Friends of the H.L. Mencken House and its sister group, the Society to Preserve H.L. Mencken's Legacy, have been patiently negotiating with Baltimore City to obtain a house transfer agreement. During this prolonged process, the Friends have become volunteer watchdogs of the house, acting as its unofficial caretaker.

A fountain might sound like a surprising addition when you're thinking water conservation, but even though recirculating fountains lose some water to evaporation and splash-out - the East Bay Municipal Utility District estimates that about 1 to 4 gallons per square foot of water per year gets lost to evaporation from pools - it still uses a lot less than the water lost to a large turf grass lawn, and the pleasure that people take in the sound of water can be well worth the trade-off.

It's a significant milestone because the publisher of the New York Times, the Boston Globe, the International Herald Tribune and 15 other daily newspapers pays most of its bills by selling ads.
No one tracks plagiarism allegations in academia nationally, so it's hard to tell how often they occur or whether they're on the rise, said John Curtis, research director for the American Association of University Professors, which advocates for faculty. Occasionally, a case will make headlines, but others are treated as confidential personnel matters, he said. Last year, two University of Kansas professors were censured for research misconduct after the university discovered four academic papers contained large amounts of plagiarized text.
The change brought resident complaints, though, prompting the decision to analyze Boyden and Holzhauer to see if the speed limits should be lower. The risk in this move?

In his speech, Cameron decried multiculturalism's "hands-off tolerance" of some cultural behaviors -- he used the example of forced marriages -- that are antithetical to Western values.

Lubanga, the head of a rebel militia that fought a devastating ethnic war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, on Wednesday had the distinction of being the first person convicted by the International Criminal Court, a decade-old institution that has been in equal measures an inspiration and a disappointment for human rights advocates. The guilty verdict is a milestone for the court that also marks the first time an international trial has focused solely on the recruitment of underage soldiers, which is forbidden in global treaties but is usually lumped in with other war-crimes charges. The successful prosecution of Lubanga — for enlisting boys and girls under 15, drugging them, putting them to work killing his enemies and using them as sex slaves — will set a precedent useful in future trials (including a trial of Kony, if he is ever captured).

But Martens said in an interview that issuing stock is not regarded as an appealing option because of the potential to dilute value of existing shares.

It is less a comment on marriage than on the notion that marriage is the holy grail of a woman's existence, the finish line of her life's hopes, dreams and goals. That is a fable upon which the Walt Disney Company built an empire. But the fable is not confined to the multiplex. To the contrary, you can see it played out on a weekly basis in the headlines of any given publication in your local supermarket checkout line.

A modern wassail is Our Special Ale from San Francisco's Anchor Brewing Co. Anchor's president, Fritz Maytag, has called his beer a "moving target": the recipe changes yearly to thwart imitators. The 2007 edition has a sharp, sweet aroma (cloves? cinnamon?), almost like an incense, and a fine-tuned equilibrium among the spices, hops and specialty malts. The spice blend is kept secret, but the beer has gotten darker over the years, adding notes of coffee and bittersweet chocolate.

It is illegal to use state campaign funds, regulated under Ohio law, for a federal campaign, regulated under federal law.

The law keeps candidates from doing an end-run around federal campaign funding restrictions.

"America's Oldest Living Teenager" was now a frail old man, and some viewers felt uncomfortable with the juxtaposition of Mr. Clark's appearance and the giddy, youthful, here's-to-the-future vibe of Times Square on New Year's Eve.

According to the EPA, the multimillion-dollar modifications resulted in 'significant net increases in sulfur dioxide emissions," at least partly because the new equipment makes the plant less prone to break down.

Although the 11th-hour drama centered on the House and the Senate, Mr. O'Malley is ultimately the one in charge, and the debacle reflects badly on him. He had some harsh words after the fact — in a 1 a.m. news conference, he decried those who let "egos and pet projects" get in the way of the "common good," and this morning, he referred to the previous night's events as a "damn shame" that set the state back. Where was he a week ago when it was clear that the two chambers were on a collision course? He needed to be publicly and aggressively involved in pushing the debate from the start, but instead, he took a laissez-faire attitude toward the legislature's handling of the budget. Tweeting "Hopeful that the GA will pass a compromise that protects priorities like education while creating jobs & expanding opportunity" two hours and 13 minutes before the legislature is set to adjourn doesn't cut it.

It also would require food stamp recipients to work or prepare for a job, much as welfare reform under President Bill Clinton required of cash aid recipients.

It is a legitimate issue and I fully agree that we need to cut down on these collisions, but the first reaction is to kill the deer. That is not going to fly with me,” he said. “People complaining that deer are causing personal property damage, I don’t believe that is a justifiable reason to slaughter deer. I don’t think it is appropriate for Avon Lake.”

It’s a place where Hamlin has won two of the last four races and usually where he kicks his season into high gear.
One would assume that Holmgren and Heckert will not again follow the same pattern of inactivity. After all, trying again in 2012 with the 2011 cast will likely produce the same results. It's obvious that the Browns need to add at least one wide receiver; focusing on both an outside threat and a slot receiver. If such a strategy seems appropriate, then a combination of Jackson and Amendola makes sense. Jackson would instantly become the lone Browns' talent that would cause an opposing defense anxiety, while Amendola could benefit from the continual underneath dump offs that are a staple of Shurmur's offense. Additionally, both players have Cleveland ties. Jackson was drafted by a front office that included Heckert and Amendola was formerly coached by Shurmur.
Viaduct Lounge does wonders with ingredients most kids would hate. A liver-loving companion wanted to try Viaduct's chicken liver special. I braced myself and took a bite. It was heavenly: breaded, fried and well-seasoned, the livers were crunchy outside, mild and buttery tender inside. Big flavors in the accompanying cheddar-jalapeno grits, studded with bits of house-made bacon, finished off a winning combination.
Today, most health professionals have finally acknowledged that chronic fatigue syndrome is a real and serious illness.

In “The 15 Minutes Job,” Gladis plays a sleazy public relations consultant, who becomes a target of Nate Ford (Timothy Hutton) and his team, as they use his own scummy methods against him.

Despite my vocation as a nonjudgmental sex educator, witness and unbiased documentarian of all sorts of sexual scenarios, I've never been the type to make public displays of affection. The only time I ever attended the Exotic Erotic Ball, I watched newbies drop trou and nonconsensually assault onlookers with drunken oral sex in public, and I simply thought, "They must be having fun," "I hope it's not a long drive back to Walnut Creek" and "Once is enough for this event for the rest of my life."

A funny thing happened while MIT researchers were testing the effects of yogurt on obese mice -- unexpected side effects sprouted up. First, yogurt-fed mice developed thick, shiny fur, with 10 times the hair-follicle density of their yogurt-deprived counterparts. And then researchers noticed that their fur wasn't all that seemed fuller. The yogurt-eating males held their whiskers high and proudly displayed their testes, which were about 15 percent heavier than males being fed low-nutrient (junk) food. The yogurt-eating males also inseminated their partners faster (and yogurt-eating females gave birth to larger and more successful litters).

At a sidewalk picnic table, I talked beer with 5Q regulars Zach Christensen and Heidi Leibbrandt, who make their own brew and grow hops at their nearby home. Christensen, who's "in telecom," nursed a pint of Lompoc's C-Note pale ale, brewed with seven hops that start with "C" (Crystal, Cluster, Cascade, Chinook, Centennial, Columbus and Challenger). It rates a chart-topping 100 International Bitterness Units, a measure of hop infusion, which Portland beer geeks bandy about the way wine fans talk about grippy tannins.

Steill says everything left here needs to find a permanent home within 24 hours. "People are so busy, coming in with things and not putting them in a specific place," she says. But the "do it later" approach always comes at a price. "Clutter is delayed decisions," she says.
The high-sympathy, low-demand ethos has made the alternative schools wildly popular with young adults turned off by the city's traditional high schools (not to mention magnets for troubled and listless teens from nearby school districts).

The newest cartons are filled with contemporary decorations such as SpongeBob or Rams ornaments and made-in-China light strands which never seem to last more than two or three years.

American discourse is the freest part of our society. It's what other people dream of as they fight for the democracy we take for granted and sometimes shame. I can't imagine what it's like to live in a country where you cannot say what you want. But just because you can doesn't mean you should.
The vote came largely along party lines, with 28 of the 30 Republicans voting for the bill and all but two of the Democrats voting against.

We've never quite been believers of UCLA at any point this season. And in spite of Sparty's failings (there have been a lot of them), we did pick them in the preseason as a Final Four team.

Why it's hot: The weekly "Pulp the Party" helped spark a renaissance for subculture dance nights in Ybor City and beyond. No need to peacock here, folks; just let your freak flag fly.

It's worth seeing for its place in Oregon film history alone: long before today's fertile, celebrated film scene, here was an independent feature production starring Portland actors and using mostly Portland crew members. Hood and producer-writer Don Gronquist will be on hand to present the movie.

Federal law often uses interstate transportation of weapons and other instruments of crime to establish jurisdiction in violent crime matters. Last year, responding to a plea from state and local leaders to suppress gun violence, this district prosecuted 218 of the worst violent criminals in federal court. In most cases, we used a law that prohibits convicted felons from possessing a gun that traveled at some point in interstate commerce. We also prosecuted the deadliest home arson in Cleveland history under a law that relied partially on the federal Section 8 housing program. Rightfully, the community expected us to use these federal tools to help in those cases.

The next New York area rapper to make himself a major player: All the buzz surrounded A$AP Rocky, who has been burning up the Internet with a laid-back, menacing delivery that owes as much to Texas hip-hop as it does to rap from his native Harlem. He backed up the hype at the MTV Woodie Awards with a strong performance that featured a guest appearance by Schoolboy Q, another net-rap favorite. But although no real hip-hop fan wants to hear this, Rocky's performance had very little on the the delirious turn by pop-rap combo Chiddy Bang. Newark-raised emcee Chidera "Chiddy" Anamege might swerve around weighty topics, but he's witty even when he's being silly, and his flow is quite a bit tighter than has been reported by hardcore purists. That's especially true in concert. Last spring, he had the kids at Bamboozle going crazy; it's good to see that his magic works in the Lone Star State, too.

One of the few bright spots in Saturday's loss was the offensive play of center Ryan Hollins, who made his first start of the season.

I touch base with Mike Veeck, the great man's son (a man of a few radical and wonderfully ridiculous notions of his own), to inquire if the descendants approve. "We've read it and enjoyed the easy flow and the research," Mike replies. "Mr. Dickson has won me over with his gentle prose."
Although Oregon's dry side was bypassed by the oil and gas boom that roiled the West in recent years, it's clear that won't be the case with wind. That could change the view from atop Steens Mountain or on Interstate 84 while driving toward Boise. But it also portends some bitter fights over who gets to use publicly owned land and for what purpose.
Revival of Missouri's economy - as it's currently constituted - will be closely tied to reviving industries that once made it strong: defense contractors and automobile manufacturing. Also, it must end the same housing market stagnation that is depressing much of the nation, said Ernie Goss, the Creighton University economist who made the dour GDP predictions.

“It really allows you to focus on yourself, not so much prep work for the other team,” the Glen Burnie native and Old Mill graduate said. “We had two stretches where we went through three games in seven or eight days, and we really just focused on ourselves and executed and sharpened some things up and then not as much personnel work for the other team. We really focused on ourselves. So I think that plays to our strengths at times because we know how good we can be and if we just perfect the things we need to do, I think we can beat anybody we need to. So in terms of playing Denver on Wednesday, we’re going to come to work on Monday, we’re going to watch the game, we’re going to correct some things and then we’re going to get after it in practice on Monday.”

The Baltimore Ravens are unlikely to be doing much business with the Bears after what Angelo described as an internal ‘‘disconnect'' and a ‘‘glitch'' that kept the team from contacting Joel Bussert at the NFL office with word they agreed to a deal with the Ravens. The Bears wanted to move up from the No. 29 selection of the first round to No. 26 and agreed to give up their fourth-round pick, No. 127 overall, in order to do so.

* Here's what I'm hoping to see from Adam Wainwright this evening at Wrigley Field: improved command. He's thrown his fastball 50 percent of the time, and it's been hittable, as we know. Opponents are batting .333 against the fastball, with a .704 slugging percentage. But the problem is more location than velocity. Wainwright has left too many fastballs over the belly of the plate; 60 percent have been in the strike zone, and he isn't getting it past many hitters who seem to be looking for it. But it's more than just the fastball; if Wainwright can have sharper command of his secondary pitches, it would make his fastball more effective. The famous Wainwright curve has been all over the place; he's thrown it in the zone only 30 percent of the time. (But on a positive note, he is getting hitters to chase it.) I've said it before, but this is a process for Wainwright. Be patient.

This is something that should have been seized upon by the Republican presidential candidates. It had all the elements found in the common GOP narrative about President Barack Obama.

"Over the last three years, the tide has turned," he declared. "We broke the Taliban's momentum. We've built strong Afghan security forces. We devastated al-Qaida's leadership, taking out over 20 of their top 30 leaders. And one year ago, from a base here in Afghanistan, our troops launched the operation that killed Osama bin Laden. The goal that I set - to defeat al-Qaida, and deny it a chance to rebuild - is within reach."

Hey, Tony: Read your article about kickers becoming "too good." I'd like to get your opinion on the following rule change which would take effect when I become king: On kickoffs, if the ball is kicked out-of-bounds on the fly, penalty places the ball on the 40, as presently. If it bounces or rolls out-of-bounds before getting to the end zone, the receiving team takes possession at that yard line, just like a punt. I think the change would add an interesting element to the game, requiring more precision than distance kicking, and may cause receiving teams to use two returners to cover the field, reducing the number of blockers by one, or risk bad field position. BTW, I happen to enjoy watching teams (not QB'd by Elway) try to succeed in 90-yard drives. -- Seren Hrachian, Athens, N.Y.

The casino's designer, Sir William Chambers, furiously busy in London as a court architect to King George III, never managed to find the opportunity to steal away and see the actual building before his death in 1796. He and the better-known Adam brothers were the architects responsible for introducing the neoclassic aesthetic to England, replacing the Baroque through their commissions for country houses, palaces and furniture. This one small building, an experiment in conjuring the grandeur of ancient Rome and Greece, contains the germ of an idea from which whole cities would later be built, first in Europe and then in America. Jefferson would have loved it.

"Once we got out here and kind of bounced around a bit, I think the guys got some energy," he said. "And I think this was outstanding. It was a good practice — you know, too many drops, horrible coming out, there are certain things that are going to happen, but those are all teachable moments."
Union Rags, the Michael Matz-trained colt, was named the second choice by Churchill Downs handicapper Mike Battaglia, at 9-2. He’ll start from the fourth position.

The first step of this is to know what to expect, which means read the recipe before you set out to cook. You do not want to be surprised when you get halfway through what seems simple to find out you need to let something rest for an hour or brine overnight.
or hospital. If an eye injury occurs, don't allow your child to touch or rub it, as this may cause more damage. Also, don't flush the eye with water or attempt to put any ointment on it. Instead, cut out the bottom of a paper cup, place it around the eye, and immediately seek medical attention - your child's eyesight may depend on it. If it's a burn, remove clothing from the burned area and run cool, not cold, water over the burn (do not use ice). Call your doctor immediately.

But the April 18 raid was not the success Peterson had envisioned. He wanted the drone to track the smugglers to a stash house, and perhaps to ranking cartel members. Instead, Border Patrol agents rushed to the riverbank, sirens blaring. They seized half a ton of pot, a 1996 Plymouth Voyager van and a boat. The smugglers escaped and no one was arrested.

Josh McCown gained 38 yards on eight carries in his first start for the Bears. The Vikings are sixth in yards per carry allowed (3.9).
1. If you don't feel polished without foundation or powder, do that first. You're probably wondering what this has to do with your eyes, but smoothing out an uneven skin tone will make whatever color you apply to your face pop. And you apply foundation and powder around the eye to diminish dark shadows and wrinkles. This step takes me less than a minute because I dot on a liquid concealer with clean finger tips and blend, blend, blend, done.

She knew how to make people feel comfortable, and through conversation make them understand that they will get better."
During a meeting break, Olson said the public hearing order change was only one of the things that frustrated her that night.

The governor has not said what he will do next, but his options are limited. He could try to place the tax extensions on the ballot without the Republican votes needed for a two-thirds majority, but that approach is legally questionable. He could try to gather signatures to put the taxes before the people via a ballot initiative, but if he does that, the temporary taxes will expire before the vote, so he would be asking for tax increases rather than merely preserving the status quo. That's a much tougher sell.

The ball bounced around the rim before falling through with 1:34 left, giving the Hawks an 87-83 lead.

Adopting a missionary attitude might be one strategy, the panel agreed. In other words, waiting for teens to seek out help won't be enough. Another strategy could be pooling the resources of the area's nearly 1,100 churches, urging church and social service groups to form a larger support network.

Betsey Stevenson, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and former chief economist at the U.S. Labor Department, said that for some women, greater career ambition means less free time and a decline in overall happiness. In studies, she has shown that as early as high school, women begin pressuring themselves to excel at work and extracurricular activities. Even at 18, they are "structuring their days more and more in pursuit of all these goals and not leaving as much time to just hang out," she said.

It's the narration that puts a damper on things. Although three-time Academy Award-winning actress Meryl Streep - who provides a third or so of the voiceover, contrary to what promotional materials indicate - does her emotive best to make us care about global warming and its impact on the Arctic's flippered and four-legged inhabitants, the script is mildly instructive at best (roughly 20,000 polar bears left on Earth, etc.) and off-puttingly preachy at worst. This a large-scale documentary, after all, not a Sierra Club ad.
Classes are held in English, but the Amish converse among themselves in Pennsylvania Deutsch, a dialect common in southwest Germany dating to the late 1600s, said Mark Oliver, the guide at the Heritage Center.

For a state dominated by Democrats, this is a rarity that GOP voters should savor. In years past, Maryland's primaries have either been lumped with too many bigger states (we were the Mr. Irrelevant of Super Tuesday), or held too late to make a difference. Competitive moments in GOP primaries of years past have been fleeting things.

“You know, we never should have been in that situation,” Reynolds said. “Chen pitched his tail off out there, and I boot that ball. That’s a play that’s got to be made. They capitalized on it, and we really couldn’t get anything going after that. It’s very, very, very frustrating.”

Ken Williams has the enviable position of seemingly being the only Chicago executive immune from the pressure to win and perform. In recent years we have seen all the Chicago franchises clean house. The Chairman needs to pocket his loyalty and let Williams go and bring in a new philosophy. I don't mean elevating Rick Hahn, either. There is a reason Hahn is still with the Sox. Frankly, I'm tired of hearing how wonderful is everyone in the Sox's organization. The chamber of commerce pitch delivered by those such as Hawk Harrelson and Steve Stone and others is insulting to knowledgeable fans. How many more years do Sox fans have to tolerate more of the same? How many more years does Williams get? -- Mike Major; Granger, Ind.

A combination of higher cost-of-living adjustments and sluggish growth in wages is pinching the fund right now. The report released Monday said reserves would be exhausted by 2033, three years sooner than projected last year. The outlook for Medicare was roughly the same as the previous year. However, that program requires major repairs to remain afloat as the cost of health care rises and the population ages. Together, Social Security and Medicare now account for about a third of the federal budget.
To say that Humm, 36, took that phrase and ran with it would be a vast understatement. He and his business partner, Will Guidara, 32, determined that the entire operation would henceforth be guided by the restless spirit of Davis, a creator who was constantly detonating his strategy. Members of the restaurant team did research to help come up with a sense of what Davis was all about -- and what words best encapsulated his ethos.

Athens, epicenter of the Greek financial crisis, offers particular bargain-hunting opportunities.

The disorder is typically treated with anticonvulsants, such as lamotrigine, carbamazapine or valproate. Such drugs are effective in controlling seizures in perhaps as many as 60% of cases. But when the patient fails treatment with at least two different drugs, their epilepsy is said to be medically refractory and they are candidates for surgery. Such surgery removes the area of the brain that is misfiring and causing the seizures. Physicians typically insert electrodes into the brain to identify the source of the electrical disturbance, then remove a small amount of tissue that is involved. The most common type of procedure is called a lobectomy.

The rest of the day underscored both the problems and pleasures of the sound-over-song approach. The Ocropolis was a 10-hour free-for-all where ATP performers joined Brooklyn band Oneida at Asbury Lanes. The musicians occasionally locked into a groove, but more often, they blanketed the room with brutal feedback and distortion. Even more punishing was Foot Village, which featured four hyperactive drummers who took turns screaming vocals. This was weirdly compelling, but far closer to performance art than music. Silver Qluster aired a solid hour (all the ATP sets were quite a bit too long) of numbing, trancelike electronica; the two musicians stood onstage, unmoving, with laptops and a synthesizer. This wasn’t a show; we weren’t being shown anything.

Prop.

"Body of Lies" could very well finish in first place, but the audience surveys suggest it's hardly a lock to claim the No. 1 position. Three of the surveys estimate that the DiCaprio-Crowe film will open to $13 million to $19 million.

Montgomery was as enthused as he has been all season when little-used freshman forward Christian Behrens scored on a driving crossover layup at 6:49 of the first half, giving Cal a 22-16 lead. For a few amusing seconds, the coach was a whirling dervish of emotion.
For Sweeney, Christie’s line-item vetoes of the Democrats’ $30.6 billion budget just days later went beyond what he called human decency.

With all of the horses seemingly healthy -- and you know how quickly that can change -- the focus here will be on the style of the race. Trinniberg, as I wrote in my story on the draw, is the wild card. Having never raced more than seven furlongs, his connections nevertheless feel convinced that their horse will win the race. Does such wild-eyed confidence mean they're prepared to let him dash from the gates and see how far he'll go? Top trainers such as Bob Baffert and Graham Motion deferred when asked yesterday how they thought the race might unfurl, saying that it would be up to the jockeys.

The district's intentions were good. Not only were too few students attempting the so-called A through G curriculum — a required series of high school English, math, social studies and other courses required for entry to California's public four-year colleges and universities — but the numbers attempting it were much lower among disadvantaged black and Latino students. Before the policy was adopted, many school administrators assumed these students were incapable of or uninterested in a future in college and steered them toward a less rigorous course of study.

Actually, though I agree Boozer has lacked some explosiveness this season, I think he finished the year very well. He was very aggressive in that Knicks game and while he did bobble some shots and passes, players talked about the ball being slick that game. Also, he's been consistently drawing double-teams and finding the open man. I don't think he gets enough credit for his passing. As the Bulls like to say, that's easy offense.

Evidently Daily is the only friendly person in town -- no matter who Kipps encounters in his dealings, the refrain is universal: Go back to the train station and return to London.

Those tests determined that baby Clara, their third child, was likely to be a perfectly normal kid inside. But even in the womb, doctors could see severe facial deformities , droopy eyes, under-developed cheekbones and a tiny jaw. It meant she'd need a tube in her neck to help her breathe after birth. The lack of an outer ear and restricted ear canals also would mean she'd have hearing aids by the time she was 6 months old.

Suddes lamented the loss of rebels who he says are being shown the door due to term limits. I would submit that a more likely culprit of legislative ills and fewer rebels is the aggressive actions taken by both the Republican and Democratic parties to handpick candidates and involve themselves in primaries to ensure their guy or gal wins. This practice breeds extreme loyalty to the parties and their leadership, but leaves we the people in the back seat.

Blepharitis is an inflammatory condition of the eyelids. The symptoms of blepharitis vary but usually include red eyelids; discharge, especially in the morning; an irritated feeling in the eyes, like something is in the eyes; and blurred or fluctuating vision. There are different types of blepharitis, however most cases result from clogging of oil glands in the eyelid, which results in red, inflamed and irritated eyelids. The surface of the eye may be prone to dryness because it is not receiving enough of the moisturizing oily secretions. Blepharitis can also be associated with other skin conditions like psoriasis or rosacea. Because your eyelids always are in contact with your eyes, this redness and inflammation can spread to the surface of the eye. In severe cases, a corneal ulcer (inflammation in the cornea seen as a white spot on the cornea) may occur.

This is why I believe the first step following the 2003 invasion of Iraq should have been the privatization of the oil fields. If the government had given every individual over 21 equal shares in a corporation that had the right and responsibility to make appropriate arrangements with foreign oil companies for the purpose of discovering and developing Iraq's oil reserves, the oil income would have flowed in the form of dividends to the people - the shareholders - rather than into government coffers.

It seems unlikely. But ReshapeOhio.org seemingly could give interested Ohioans, if not a seat at the drawing table, at least their best opportunity yet to understand (and critique) what up to now has been, de facto, a private Statehouse undertaking.

But an opinion that in theory is eminently just threatens to result in a manifest injustice in Baltimore. At first blush, the high court's ruling appears to bolster the case of former Baltimore Catholic school teacher John J. Merzbacher, who was sentenced to four life terms on six counts of child rape and sexual abuse and faced 100 other charges for similar crimes. He destroyed dozens of lives, and despite his age (70) and years in prison, his victims still fear for themselves, their children and for the community. But a federal judge agreed last year with his contention that he was never informed of a plea offer, and that echoes the circumstances of one of the cases the Supreme Court addressed this week. For what he has done, Mr. Merzbacher deserves to spend the rest of his life in prison. Fortunately, the court ruling leaves open several avenues for Maryland officials to make sure he does.

But the attacks, which paralyzed much of Kabul, also point to a central conundrum. Western officials portray this brand of urban warfare as a sign of insurgents' frustration with their inability to directly take on NATO forces on the battlefield. But the Taliban and other militant groups instead see success; the mere ability to carry out attacks of this size and scope, they believe, undermines the faith of Afghan citizens that their government can protect them.

In recent days his campaign and friendly political action committees have poured millions into negative campaign ads that imploded Gingrich's rising star.

Despite the unapologetic nature of the GT-R, it's hard to argue with the sheer value the car presents.

Noah got hurt midway through the third quarter of Friday night's loss at Philadelphia. He played briefly in the fourth quarter, before leaving the arena on crutches. The eighth-seeded Sixers lead the series 2-1, winning both games after Chicago's Derrick Rose tore a knee ligament and went down for the playoffs.

So what I saw from both sides of my family was drinking, drug use, abuse, and cheating. But I've been happily married for over 10 years and with my husband for almost 20. We have two beautiful children who know without a doubt that they're loved. They're well-adjusted children.
Analysts said the trend could gradually spur lawmakers to shift the focus of their immigration debates to the more than 10 million undocumented immigrants already living in the United States, not those trying to cross the border. The Pew Hispanic Center estimates that about two-thirds of the undocumented population has been in the states for at least a decade.
In front of children, in professional settings and in polite company, most Americans no longer think it is OK to make racist jokes about black people. We recognize that it is both hurtful and inaccurate to judge someone's intentions by their skin color or ethnic origin. But when it comes to Muslims and people from Muslim countries, we lose those same sensibilities. So why do my kind, liberal-minded friends make such comments without realizing the offense they're causing?
A slew of measures have been floated recently but according to Booker and city council members, each idea is less plausible than the last:
Tomlin (0-1, 7.20) allowed four runs on nine hits in five innings. He tied a career high with seven strikeouts, but was gone after five innings because he threw 95 pitches.
Just as I'm doubting the wisdom of having spent money to join a death march, we reach our first summit. There, awaiting us, is the greatest watermelon ever created. Cut into pieces by the guide's machete, the cool, sweet slices of goodness lay spread on wooden tables as a reward for the ascent. A small shack there also sells Gatorade, granola bars, even menthol cigarettes, for those seeking that refreshing smoky mint taste.

The proposal is an alternative to bipartisan legislation expected soon from Democratic Reps. Peter DeFazio and Kurt Schrader, and Republican Rep. Greg Walden.

Cook, 35, looked on sheepishly as her attorney, Eric Olson, chalked up the dispute to a misunderstanding and some missed messages with the receivership. But when Olson and Norgard asked Chief U.S. District Judge Michael Davis to approve the agreement resolving the dispute, he cracked the whip.
At 9 a.m. this Tuesday, he is on hold with a radio station in Tucson and in an interview with another in St. Louis. He has three more lined up.
Although it seems like a modern creation, the hot-and-cold, cake-and-ice-cream concept has been around for nearly two centuries. But it was after the United States purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867 that chefs at the famed New York restaurant Delmonico's added a dessert called Alaska-Florida to their menu. By the early 1900s, this same dish of cake, ice cream, and curly clouds of meringue was featured in Fannie Merritt Farmer's "Boston Cooking-School Cook Book" as Baked Alaska.
"One of the people I’m running against, Sen. Santorum, goes to Washington and calls himself a budget hawk. Then after he’s been there awhile says he’s no longer a budget hawk," Romney said. "Well I am a budget hawk."
We're definitely working on what we call dual-mode technology, that allows people to have the Clear network and the performance of a 4G network (in Portland) and then roam nationwide on Sprint's network. That's coming along. We don't have any firm product to announce yet, but we're testing that.
For Dusty Watt, it's all in a season's work.
"Eyes of Justice" is the fourth in the New York Times-bestselling series I co-write with Lis Wiehl that features an FBI agent, a TV reporter, and a federal prosecutor. It's hard to talk about the plot too much without giving away a big spoiler, but a major character is killed in the book. Publishers Weekly says it's "Shocking, fast-paced."

But the Long decision may well prove to one of the last significant developments in Kroger's turbulent stint as attorney general. He announced Tuesday that he will leave the office in July to become president of Reed College.
GM would not deny reports Friday that it is preparing to scrap its Pontiac brand. The company issued a statement saying that no announcement had been made.
But federal law makes all marijuana possession and sales illegal. Drug sales within 1,000 feet of a school bring enhanced penalties. Walsh said he sent the letters because he's concerned that the presence of medical-marijuana businesses near schools may be encouraging the increase the state is seeing in youth use of marijuana.

The court-appointed receiver searching for assets in the midden of a collapsed $190 million Ponzi scheme headed by Minneapolis money manager Trevor Cook seems to be running short of patience.
He departed St. Louis two days later. He returned in 1953 for Washington University's centennial celebration, when he confessed to holding guarded hope for civilization. He visited again in 1959 to speak at Mary Institute in Ladue (now Mary Institute St. Louis Country Day Academy and, like Smith, once a prep school for Washington U.) Eliot died in London on Jan. 5, 1965 at age 76.
The deal also forecloses on one of the best, lowest-cost opportunities for increasing refuge water supply and achieving a sustainable water balance in the Klamath. To protect a sweetheart deal for a small group of irrigators, the settlement attempts to perpetuate commercial leaseland farming on 22,000 acres of Tule Lake and Lower Klamath refuges and asks taxpayers to subsidize this harmful practice. In contrast, phasing out this federally managed program, using those lands to store winter water, and using the 1905 priority date water rights associated with those lands for fish and wildlife purposes would represent a huge step toward a sustainable Klamath Basin -- at a fraction of the cost of the settlement deal.
The city of Florissant last month issued a position statement, raising concerns with the supplemental study. And Congressman Russ Carnahan, D-St. Louis, has pressured the agency to overhaul its plan to contain the waste.

After a successful stint at Phoenix College, a friend suggested that Carr attend Texas Western University (now University of Texas at El Paso). Carr's recruitment trip to El Paso was eventful, as the car he was in broke down and legendary UTEP basketball coach Don Haskins wound up picking up the stranded Carr.
In the Gator Bowl, the Buckeyes will get what a lot of fans have been looking for all season, and what was going to be the plan at the end of the regular season before senior Andrew Sweat got hurt. Though both are weakside linebackers, Sweat and Shazier will start together for the first time this year, with Sweat moving to middle linebacker to make it work. Both players are excited about the possibilities. Sweat was the Buckeyes' leading tackler through the first 10 games, averaging 6.8 per game. Shazier was the leading tackler in the final two regular-season games when starting in place of the injured Sweat, averaging 11.5.

That's when the doctor suggested the pair check out the Wellness Center.
Collison, who came off the bench behind Hill on Monday, agrees that he should continue to rest his groin to avoid any further setbacks before the playoffs start April 28.
I walk my dogs most mornings at a particular greenbelt area. Along the way I meet Bonnie the pitbull and her "dad"; Harley the Australian shepherd and her mom; Anubis the Labrador and his dad; the "parents" of Newfie Buddha, Australian cattle dog Sally, shiba inu Shibi and many others. We always stop to talk with each other while our dogs meet and greet. There's nothing like a happy-go-lucky dog to help break the ice and get people talking. If your daughter is shy, this would be a great way for her to meet people and break out of her shell. Dogs are terrific therapists in this regard.
A Northwest Indiana man who told police he was an 899-year-old god while being arrested for breaking into homes and hiding in a closet will spend a year on probation.
Manufacturing is doing quite well. One sector that didn't add jobs is government, which is still adjusting to tight budgets and probably will for some time. 8.3 percent unemployment is still terrible. There are almost 13 million unemployed. There are 5 million long-term unemployed. But if the unemployment rate descends to the low-7-percent range by November, it will substantially improve the Democrats' chances to hold on to the White House.
The cons: She dresses trampy. Like Jodie Foster in "Taxi Driver."

The restaurant's vegetable "coins" ($13) are reminiscent of Indian kofta - they're fried patties of broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and celery. But here they're served in Manchurian sauce, a puree of broccoli with soy sauce, onion and ginger. The result is a comforting dish, if a little greasy, though it's good for absorbing spiciness.
In the first meeting of the teams with both ranked since 1982, the 23rd-rated Wildcats smothered and clogged No. 7 Mizzou's previously free-flowing offense to inflict one last indignity at Bramlage Coliseum.
State Assemblyman John F. McKeon told one panel today that federal stimulus money can bring about a "green partnership" to power alternative energy production and generate millions of green jobs for New Jersey.
When Petro campaigned for the state legislature, he said he believed in the death penalty. And when he supported the 1981 bill, he argued that the government should not bear the expense of incarcerating the most heinous criminals when they deserve to die. In short, he said that he believed the state would save money by adopting the death penalty and that the law would become a deterrent.

“To go back and compare this budget in detail with a budget four years ago is an exercise you can assign to some public administration class,” Ricci said. “I’m not going to do it. I don’t have the time or inclination to do that.”
It is based in Khopoli, near Mumbai in western India and has 1,400 workers. In the year ending March 31, it had sales of $890 million and made a profit of $21 million.
It's what Allen's done to Pritchard here. And it's curious, considering all the regret the Blazers once blathered about when the organization gave up on a young Jermaine O'Neal. I can't count the number of times in the last eight years that O'Neal's name has been offered as proof that the franchise has learned not to give up on a young, talented employee who hasn't yet realized his potential.
Is it appropriate to bark because the others around you are barking louder? As thoughtful citizens won't we add more value to the process of democracy by devoting dedicated time to reading and thinking about how to state our opinions? Or, is it just easier to bark even though some of us haven't the slightest idea what we are barking about?
Newark police spent $187,621 of its $4 million overtime budget on costs associated with Houston’s funeral, police spokesman Sgt. Ronald Glover said.

The Lakers have now won 12 of their last 13 games, and their only loss since the all-star break was a nail biter at Miami. In their last 10 games, they’ve held their opponents to around 87 points per game. As much as we were searching for ways that Portland could score late in this game, and starting to blame the Blazer offense, most of the credit goes to the L.A. defense.

On such occasions, I wish to warn, "It's a lot harder than it looks."
Think about this. Barnes & Noble—a company that is, ahem, hardly in the forefront of technological innovation—has managed to put together a pretty good Android tablet from scratch in short order, and is selling it for $250 (and even less if, like me, you catch a promotion). It's not a top-of-the-range model, but it does include a superb screen—and analysts will tell you that's typically one of the most expensive parts of a tablet.

The decision sparked public outcry, and even local Komen affiliates expressed their opposition to the move; California’s seven local affiliates wrote a letter stating, “Affiliates will not rest until this issue is resolved....

We’ve seen a number of cases with Google employees who were using this where they’ve discovered things they had no idea was going on, but turned out to be major problems with their houses. One person who was lucky enough to have a pool in her back yard discovered her pool pump had been on 24 hours a day for, probably, the past several years and costing her several thousand dollars. You compare your house to others with similar demographics and you find things that are way out of whack.

At the same time, Kaplan said that the device's one-year design life may limit its effectiveness as a long-term solution to obesity and diabetes. By giving a diabetic's pancreas a year to rest, it may improve a patient's long-term outlook, he speculated. And some patients, he added, may benefit from having the device implanted over and over, with a break in between. But such possibilities have yet to be demonstrated in clinical trials, he cautioned.
On his meddlesome father: "One thing I talked with my dad about is my dad can be a bit negative at times, just because he wants the best for me and he's scared that I'm not going to do the right thing. He always looks at it from the point of I'm not doing enough, you can always do more. I talked to him about trying to be positive with me, keep me in a positive light and I think that's something that can help me because he is such a big influence on my game and my overall mentality. Positivity, stay positive, because I think if I stay positive and I'm having fun, like last year at the beginning of the season with St. Louis, I was having fun, just relaxing, playing the game, and I played great. If I can try to do that all year, stay positive, have a lot of positive vibe coming at me, it'll help my game."

Bob Hertzberg, a Democrat and former Assembly speaker from Los Angeles who co-chairs the group, calls its effort a "statewide diagnostic," with dozens of meetings to test ideas with everyday citizens. The goal has been to hit a bipartisan sweet spot, homing in on proposals that appeal to conservatives and liberals alike.
More likely, the city would "re-enter" the county as its 92nd municipality. The city of St. Louis would keep its own mayor and aldermen and fire department. But it likely would shed many of the functions that St. Louis County also performs, such as collecting property taxes and running a prosecutor's office and its own courts. It would, governmentally speaking, become a giant urban Kirkwood.
Asked about these punishments during his visit to Washington last week, Mexican President Felipe Calderon told CNN, "That used to be true, but it's not true anymore."

Part One is the most fun, with its chapters on how Chronicle Executive Editor Scott Newhall turned a once-drab newspaper into "The Daily Circus" of the 1950s and 1960s; on "The Free City" of the proto-hippie movement the Diggers; and Talbot's account of early drag queens and the outrageous, LSD-fueled gender-bending chorus line that was the Cockettes.

And as a food lover, it would be wrong not to take advantage of modern opportunities -- access to better ingredients, techniques, influences from other cultures. In Jersey City, the sandbox is full of children from different cultures, the grocery shelves stocked with ingredients that not so long ago seemed quite exotic. And Lyons is an inquisitive, creative chef, with an appreciation for other cuisines. Why wouldn't he try new things?

The economy turned in another lackluster month for job creation in April, with 115,000 net new jobs, 130,000 in private business (less 15,000 fewer in government). The unemployment rate fell a tick to 8.1%, albeit mainly because the labor force shrank by 342,000. This relates to what is arguably the most troubling trend in the April jobs report, which is the continuing decline in the share of working-age Americans who are in the labor force.

The two first met while working in an environment where the ability to generate a joke was particularly valued: "Da Ali G Show," Sacha Baron Cohen's absurdist HBO series in which political and cultural figures were interviewed by Cohen while he assumed the guises of white rapper Ali G or clueless Kazakh reporter Borat. Rogen was a writer and Reiser was an associate producer responsible for booking guests without revealing that they'd be participating in a comedic sneak attack instead of a real talk show.

Sheamus and Daniel Bryan finally had the match fans have been waiting for, and it did not disappoint. Iin the match of the night, both men delivered great twists and turns, with Bryan garnering much of the attention (and fan support) from the Chicago crowd. After Bryan deliberately got himself disqualified after failing to respond to a ref's 5 count leading to the first fall, Bryan locked in the “Yes” lock, leading to fall No. 2 after Sheamus passed out. Once he came to, a rehash of WrestleMania's 18-second match seemed to be the path for fall No. 3, but Bryan kicked out. Eventually, a second Brogue Kick would seal the deal. Though Bryan doesn't hold the World Heavyweight title, he proved that he is a champion in terms of someone who can be counted on to always be one half of a fantastic match in big-stage situations.
The visual trickery and CGI technology that allowed a likeness of late rapper Tupac Shakur to appear onstage for two songs at the Coachella music festival took quickly to the Twitter trends. Tupac also became the No. 1 Google search Monday. The whole affair caused two immediate reactions online. First, wonder. Then, jokes. Here's some of the latter (video below from Sethward Productions NSFW, but hilarious):

This is where China and its $3.2 trillion in foreign reserves come in. If China were to contribute to a bailout fund that Europe wants to build up to $1.4 trillion, it would surely ask for concessions in return, like the Europeans dropping their criticism of China's undervalued currency. China also might wonder why it should come to the rescue of a European Union that still has it under an arms embargo. History comes full circle, with the ascendant Chinese in a position to extract concessions from erstwhile colonial powers.

U-Boat watches go up to 55 centimeters in diameter. The company, launched five years ago, claims as its heritage a sketch that its designer's grandfather made for the Italian military during World War II.

Once you answer that question, you will become more audience-centered in your communication. If you can’t answer the "so what" questions, much of what you have to say will fall on deaf ears because in your audience, so many of them are thinking to themselves "so what?" It’s a lot better for you to think that as a speaker and answer it, and then shape your communication in response.

Nicolaus Balla, who earned three stars cooking Japanese dishes at Nombe, turned his talents to Hungarian food when he took over the kitchen at this restaurant owned by Chad Robertson and Elisabeth Prueitt from Tartine Bakery. Who knew that he grew up in Budapest and loved the food? He's given the menu a light California touch; you might even find a little Japanese seaweed adding its umami to many dishes. Balla is also a master at pickles - there's often at least five on the menu. For his part, bread master Robertson makes a fried potato bread. The restaurant has recently been remodeled to include a space next door and a sandwich and retail shop.

Turns out that was just a taste of the drama to come for the Blazers (20-23), who fell to 1-4 on a seven-game trip that has been a disaster. The Blazers managed just 12 points and five field goals in the first quarter and trailed 55-29 at halftime. At that point, it was fair to wonder if the Blazers would finish with more turnovers than field goals, because they had 17 turnovers and 11 made shots. By the time the game mercifully ended, five Knicks had reached double figures in scoring -- including Smith (23 points), Steve Novak (20), Amare Stoudemire (17) and Carmelo Anthony (16) -- and they had outshot the Blazers 53.8 percent to 37.3. Really, New York dominated the Blazers in every statistical category.

There are some cases when a needle biopsy can't be performed. Depending on where the growth is located, it might be too close to the chest wall to safely use a needle. Also, if a needle biopsy results don't align with the physician's original assessment, then a more invasive approach may be needed. There are simple questions you can ask your doctor to determine whether he or she offers this procedure. Ask how they approach a biopsy - percutaneously or open? Also ask if he or she is OK with you getting a second opinion. Your doctor should be comfortable with it. If he or she appears angry, it should be a red flag to the patient. It's most important for you as the patient to be comfortable and feel like you have a connection with your physician.

Alas, there is a less-than-enthralling performance, and that belongs to Knightley as Sabina Spielrein. When we first encounter her, she is a frantic Russian patient, sexually deranged following years of abuse. Knightley is all contorted face and lunging jaw, and it's all a bit over-the-top. Her eventual transformation is remarkable, and as the film shifts from Switzerland to Vienna, and ticks off the years from 1904 to the eve of the first World War in 1914, we encounter a Spielrein we never could have imagined.

Hales: Well, I'm interested in continuing this regional effort of building partnerships. And that's something I'm good at. I've done it before. I've been very involved in building across the whole metropolitan area about things, whether it was about the urban growth boundary or building a transit system. For example, when I was involved in the transit agenda, we really helped the mayor of Hillsboro and her advocacy to get light rail to not just stop in Beaverton but all the way out to Hillsboro. Look at the effect of that with Nike and Intel and other folks on the line. So the same thing goes for the arts. Part of what I can bring is credibility in the whole region, and a belief that we are an organic region that needs to work together.

One reason is that pride focuses attention on the self (not the cake) and on success rather than failure.

Simply put, anticipating pride makes us feel good, and anticipating shame makes us feel bad.

But this is a story of just the opposite, as shown by a Plain Dealer review of lobbying reports, campaign contribution records, corporate financial filings, government audits and interviews to examine how a single Ohio company interacts with Washington.

"I think there's an under-appreciation of the seismic hazard in Orange County," Grant Ludwig said. "There is a general perception in Orange County that we don't have as much earthquake hazard" — in part because the county has not suffered a major, destructive quake since 1933, when the area was sparsely populated.

Girardi said, “All of our guys threw bullpens and BPs before they threw in games, so we’ll see. I don’t think it’s unrealistic to say we’ll see him throw in a game before we leave Florida. But I don’t think it’s realistic that he’ll throw five innings in one start.

I think the draft is a little deeper now that you get to see these guys."

While the microphone keys work a bit differently on the two platforms, they are basically similar. When the keyboard appears, ready for you to type, you can instead hit the microphone key and simply dictate what you want to say. The phones then send your spoken words to a remote server, which rapidly translates them into text and sends them back to the phone's screen. If corrections are needed, you make them by typing, though both platforms make this easier by indicating the likeliest errors, and suggesting alternatives.
"I thought I would get some kind of feeling from the Browns or some other team, that they'd say something or hint at something that would give me a feeling on where I was going to go, but I really have no clue," Tannehill said in a phone interview Monday. "I'm in the dark."

Hales: This is so critical. I've talked to so many parents going door to door campaigning for this office who really want to maintain support for public schools in Portland. But there's quite a bit of fatigue among those parents who have had to have auction after auction to keep the arts program in their neighborhood school. We have been holding education together with duct tape and bake sales in this city. That's commendable for those activists, but fatiguing as well. We have to put education on firm footing. Arts and culture have to be part of that basic understanding of what school will provide for kids. So that's why I keep coming back to education. If our kids aren't artists by the time they graduate from high school, the odds they'll care about the arts and have the joy of experiencing it in their adult life is pretty low. I raised my kids with an appreciation for the arts. I'm proud of them. My daughter is a modern dancer, working in New York. My son is a stage manager at Milagro, as I mentioned. That's important to me.

If you do want to sext with your partner, realize that you are taking a risk and make sure that you are only sending nude photos to someone you deeply trust. If you do want to give your partner a sexy picture, you might want to go the old-school route and give them a printed photo. Just don't be cavalier with these intimate pictures, and remember, it is preferable to erase these photos from your phone or computer when finished with them.

But he also left himself at risk should he become injured again.

While I have not been enamored with President Obama’s performance, the Republican presidential primaries have reaffirmed that he is a superior alternative to any of the Republican candidates. Gingrich, Santorum, Romney and Paul would, no doubt, see my position on expanding the safety net in the short run, to assist those who are unable to find work because of the economic downturn, and my call for reducing income inequality, as evidence that I favor turning America into a “European-style welfare state ... that would poison the very spirit of America,” as Mitt Romney has said about Obama’s efforts.

Redei's team later tested the blood of 28 adolescents in Ohio, half of whom had been diagnosed with major depression.

John Feehery, a Republican strategist in Washington, said the controversy boosts Republican criticism that the 2010 health-care overhaul backed by Obama was an over-extension of government.

Jhoulys Chacin (11-14, 3.62 ERA in 2011) did not have a strong spring, slowed initially by biceps tendinitis and later by a blister on his right index finger. Both compromised his velocity. He ended the spring reaching 92 mph on the radar gun, with impressive sink. For Chacin, a quick start is imperative after he closed last season with a 4.58 ERA after June 21. April is his best month (2.83 ERA), and he has held the Giants to a .211 average in seven games. Barry Zito (3-4, 5.87) is a shell of the pitcher who won a Cy Young. He's changed positioning to the first-base side of the rubber, but does not have much variance between his 83- to 85-mph fastball and other pitches. Troy E. Renck, The Denver Post

If I were a player, it would drive me crazy. It would keep me up at night. But the professional mindset doesn't allow that.

Same thing with teammate Patrick Marleau.

Is there something different about guys in law enforcement and the military? Since they are required to exude an intimidating kind of macho in their daily work, does that dictate a high testosterone ethic in every part of their lives?

Are they like members of a football or rugby team who revel in male bonding rituals that almost invariable include proving sexual mastery?

You're all about sports, and you've scored tickets to see the Clippers or Kings or Lakers at Staples Center, next to the L.A. Live entertainment complex near the southern end of downtown. Congratulations, especially if those are Laker seats. Now, there are more than a dozen restaurants and bars in L.A. Live, not to mention the Grammy Museum, a JW Marriott Hotel and a Ritz-Carlton, both of which opened in 2010. But that's not where you're sleeping. You're heading eight blocks northeast to the Los Angeles Athletic Club, which has 72 hotel rooms that many people have never heard about. From the outside, the LAAC is a humdrum hulk among the gem merchants that make up downtown's Jewelry District, but inside, it's a piece of sweat-soaked L.A. history, with two restaurants and bars, pools, weights, squash courts, basketball courts and walls crowded with fascinating old artworks and photos. Book a room and you get the same access that the club's members do. (Yes, male and female, adults and children.) The hotel rooms, upgraded from 2007-2009, are dark, woodsy and clubby. For less than the cost of a room at the Marriott or Ritz, you can walk and run in the footsteps of Esther Williams, and Johnny Weissmuller and dozens of less-celebrated Olympic medalists. ( Charlie Chaplin spent a lot of time here too.) Alas, the indoor pool's high dive is no more, but you can still peek through the underwater window that diving coaches used to watch their protégés splash down.
Striking at an opponent without intending to annihilate his ability to resist (by either conventional or unconventional means) is like waterskiing without skiis.

Together, Colin and Isabella have taken what was always a rugged and beautiful valley and breathed new life into it. "It was quite derelict—the whole valley was really shot to pieces and it had an element of decay about it," says Colin. One of the basic problems was that it was overrun with sheep, which had "bonsai'ed" the property's ancient wild birches. Colin relocated the tenant farmer and his sheep to another part of the estate. Within 15 years, upward of half a million birch trees have replanted on their own. "It feels brighter now," Colin says. "The valley just has more sparkle in it." Now, flocks of blackface swales graze in the fields in an organized fashion and in the winter are taken down to the sea for lambing.

The reasoning on the part of the Faroese was rather funny: They said, Well, if we don’t kill any whales, then you’re not going to have a TV show. So we’re not going to kill any whales.

Dear Margo: I recently was baptized and joined the Mormon Church. I really enjoy my new "family" except for one person: the bishop. This feeling is taboo because people act like he walks on water. I say he is just a man appointed to a position. This man didn't like me the minute he met me. When I started at this church, I was in crisis, and I told a couple of people about it. They said go to the bishop. He turned me down flat-out and said, "We don't help people financially." That was a bald-faced lie, and I knew it. The excuses I got were that I was not a member yet, that he was stressed, blah, blah, blah. As time progressed, my problem became worse. Again, I was turned down, and he didn't even call me by the right name. I corrected him twice about my name, and he still got it wrong, which was proof to me that he was doing it on purpose. Do you think I am making something out of nothing? And to whom do I go to let someone know about this person? I think he treats me badly because I am disabled. (I think this because there are other disabled people who also dislike him.) — Disillusioned

Also, despite having the worst record in the West, the Hornets are starting to play well -- the win was their third in three games.

A A flood. A few hundred requests rolled in and continue to arrive for bumper stickers that readers recommended to remind drivers to use their turn signals. Your sticker and "Be a Thinker.

Strictly speaking, he says, the only products that the FDA actually "approves" are drugs and serious high-tech medical devices such as implantable defibrillators.

Why it's hot: Two words: sequins and shame. The drag queens at Blur — including well-known performers Natasha Richards, Melanie Minyon and Stephanie Shippae — love to tease the adoring crowd. Richards, decked in leather pants and pasties, recently called a Paris Hilton clone in the club "Paris Ramada." It's one?half hilarious comedy routine, one?half fierce lip sync concert (Alejandro, Vogue, lots of fringe and twirling) with an open dance floor between sets. And it's all tucked away in tidy little Dunedin.

"Hello, congressman," a couple of patrons said softly, while others returned his smile or lifted a hand in greeting.
Perot became a caricature, thanks to his own erratic behavior and comedian Dana Carvey's devastating portrayal. So it's easy to forget that in May 1992, the Texan led both incumbent George H.W.

Available at local Coach stores at Beachwood Place and Crocker Park, Westlake.
"The Maryland State Board of Education has already looked at this issue from this particular document and said it's not an education issue," Dyer said to Aquino.

The Texas lawmaker didn't say so, but the other campaign already built for a long campaign was Romney's. The former Massachusetts governor was closeted with aides and his family as he sweated out the caucus count in a state that humbled him four years ago.

From the Czech Republic to Greece, the eastern part of Europe is changing so fast that you could visit every year and feel as if you've experienced something completely new. As the European Union subsidizes development in its relatively poorer countries, a lot of EU money is flowing east. With this financial aid and the release of so much pent-up energy in the last generation, there's plenty of good news for travelers in 2009.

Brahms: Piano Concerto No. 2.
Is everything too broad of an answer? You're almost doubling the amount of space for the same amount of people. You don't want to blast Candlestick for being an older building because there have been a lot of great moments there, but the new building is going to be a completely different experience. Instead of just making a nice hot dog, you can do 20 to 30 different items. It'll probably be a 50 percent quicker exit than what you see at Candlestick. You can't compete with that, being able to park easily and get to your car and out onto the freeway quicker or take public transit.

Would you drive more than four hours for biscuits and gravy, especially if they come with a side of Old Florida? The restaurant at the historic lodge at Wakulla Springs State Park, about 20 miles south of , serves some of the best Southern breakfast fare we've ever had. But that's not the only reason to go there. The kids will love to gaze at Old Joe, the stuffed 11-foot alligator in the lobby that was pulled from the springs way back when. The adults will love sitting in the comfy chairs, soaking in the atmosphere that seems little changed from when the lodge was built in 1937. There's even an old-fashioned soda counter for ice cream cones. In the summer, cool off in the springs, where the water temperature is about 70 even in August. Hike nature trails and go on the Jungle Cruise, a boat trip along the Wakulla River where you'll see alligators, deer, osprey, turtles and sun-basking anhingas with their wings spread wide. The Creature From the Black Lagoon was filmed here and Johnny Weissmuller swung from the trees in his Tarzan movies. Lodging is about $100 a night and there's a $6 entry fee to the park. For more information and directions, call (850)926-0700 or go to floridastateparks.org. The Wakulla Wildlife Festival is March 19-20.

Speaking of food, hotel and restaurant meals add up quickly for families. If you don't have access to free breakfast and nibblies in hotels with club levels (such as the newly remodeled club at the Sheraton and Hyatt in Waikiki), keep in mind the food courts at Royal Hawaiian Center (upper level) and the Waikiki Shopping Plaza (underground), which have a mix of "local," Asian and mainland mall-style options.

A salt-and-pepper-haired man rises from the row of seats just behind the Blazers' bench, contemplates Camby's words, and shouts back. "Power. Power." Camby yells "Power" to Andre Miller, who yells it to Wesley Matthews, and before the opponent readies to inbound the ball, every Blazers player on the court knows exactly what play is about to be run and exactly how they are supposed to defend it.

There have been a handful of other arrests of TSA employees since the agency was created in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
My husband deserves the credit for coming up with the name. We had a long running discussion about how dangerous my spiky plant obsession would be when we finally adopted a pug, since they have such buggy eyes. When I mentioned starting a blog it took him about 3 minutes to come up with the name, it was perfect on so many levels. I garden on the edge of what is hardy here in Portland, which is emotionally dangerous (watching plants you love die a slow death isn't something I'd recommend). And, the money I can spend on plants, also a bit dangerous, financially.
The measure would curb the powers enjoyed by the deposed President Hosni Mubarak, who used the military tribunals to refer opponents, especially Islamists.

Last summer, a 6-foot-long bull snake crawled into the bathroom and draped itself over the doorknob. Howard ran and got her neighbors, Don and Shirley, Bob and Iola. The men took it out of the house, bashed in its head with a rake and then threw it in a tree. Howard also ran over a snapping turtle in her Mini Cooper, another occasion to summon the neighbors.
They did it with hip-hop that was both aggressively political and unrepentantly commercial. The Fugees could speak for the underclass and then turn around and repackage the Roberta Flack hit “Killing Me Softly” into a radio-ready showcase for Hill’s emerging voice. “Fu-Gee-La,” a massive hit, wedded references to Louis Farrakhan and crack babies (among many other things) to a hook lifted from a featherweight Teena Marie song. The group sampled or otherwise reinterpreted music by Enya, Afrika Bambaataa, Kenny Rogers and French protest crooner Michel Sardou. All contradictions were steamrollered by the group’s irresistible choruses, which drew from classic soul, reggae and cheesy ’60s pop as well as throwback positive rap.
Our recipe for Hanukkah is a variation on the traditional chili-sauce-braised brisket. We use bottled chili sauce in a nod to tradition, then intensify the flavors with strong black coffee and a hearty porter beer. The result is a fork-tender pot roast with rich and flavorful mahogany-colored gravy.
The report also mentions that lower-wage dads are less likely than those with good-paying jobs to be involved with their children. But it's not the job that a dad has, it's the attention he pays that is important, and all fathers need to realize that. Maybe they worry they don't have much to share. But they do.
Kovalchuk did have an assist on Travis Zajac's power-play goal Sunday, but the Devils did not sign him to a $100 million, 15-year deal to set up other players.
About every 10 games or so, I ask him if he wants Paul George to be more assertive offensively. And every time I ask, he looks at me like I'm half nuts (I get this look a lot from people) and talks about all the other good things George does -- like defend, rebound, pass the basketball.

“Have I? No I haven’t,” Dincuff said.
Cell phone makers often give U.S. carriers exclusive rights to sell a model, but usually only for six months or so. Apple signed a multi-year contract with AT&T, probably so AT&T would carry a phone that broke many industry rules. Apple had complete control over the software on the phone, and it was linked to Apple's music and video stores, not AT&T's. When the App Store came along a year later, that was completely controlled by Apple as well.
Tim Spinner, 33, moving with vibrant salsas, inventive ceviches and duck-stuffed chiles en nogada in his wake, is now finally basking in his own light.

Notes: Thompson suffered a shoulder injury last spring and had surgery. He also has undergone surgery for an appendectomy. It would seem unlikely the two procedures would have anything to do with him having a heart attack. ... Riley noted Thursday that Thompson had gone through some difficult physical issues to reach the point where he would be scrapping for a spot in the defensive line rotation when spring ball starts March 12. (There are three practices before spring break). ... "I was so proud of him. He's come a long way since he got here,'' said Riley. "I just enjoyed being around him. He had that great, great smile. Everybody liked Fred, is the best way to say it. He was a big 'ol guy. Fun to be around. ... he was like the perfect teammate.''
Such problems may be especially common among the poor, but poor dental health in children transcends social and economic boundaries.

A few days before the MCA opening, Johnson stood in the center of a gallery and cast a seriously-don't-talk-to-me-now look on his face. Museum workers swirled around him and artwork sat on the floor, covered in blankets; bubble wrap lay strewn about. Johnson was quiet, moving from room to room. He bundled his dreadlocks together, tied them in a bun, then a moment later, he released them. Then repeated the process.

I've heard some stripped-down versions of this song, and it works perfectly well that way, but Monáe goes in the other direction, using her own band plus a big orchestra, and still makes the song sound as lean and mean as ever. She also does the same thing that Jackson 5 did, taking lyrics that are about romantic anguish and, by the sheer power of her delivery, making something joyful out of them.

Bullying of those who appear to be different from the group, and especially those perceived to be weak, is a sad and sorry state of the human condition. It has existed across the millennia, across most cultures, and is often celebrated in America today in such forms as celebrity gossip and sleazy reality "entertainment." While we decry each publicized act of bullying, we turn our backs on a much larger cultural context, ignoring the slippery slope that often leads the most aggressive among us to seek approval from a group, or revenge against a perceived enemy by physical or verbal acts that hurt.

Role: Miller's Blazers tenure got off to a rocky start, but by the end of last season Miller had endeared himself to teammates and fans with his no-nonsense approach and rugged game. He arguably was the team's MVP last season and will be counted on to provide veteran savvy, floor leadership and scoring as the starting point guard in 2010-11. Concerns remain about his on-court chemistry with Brandon Roy, but when the duo is clicking, they form a dynamic backcourt.

He was right, just like he had been decades earlier when he believed a Ford V8 in a light body would blow past more expensive German, Italian and English racers. Carroll Shelby didn't see limits. He kept his eye on the finish line and the checkered flag.
K-12 public education is partially to blame. During the late 1960s, a sense emerged that the performance of high schools had declined — judging from the reasoning, English and math skills of college freshman, employers were probably right.
His work's simplicity, its elements pretty well established by the time of McLaughlin's 1952 solo debut at Felix Landau Gallery, is deceptive. But its acute perceptual sophistication would set the stage for 1960s Light and Space art — for Robert Irwin, Doug Wheeler, Larry Bell and others whose sculptures and installations forged L.A.'s first distinctive contribution to American art. McLaughlin was their forerunner.

"Thank God for my wading boots, as there unfortunately is broken glass as well. Every single back eddy had trash floating in it," he said. "(Crawford's) biggest piece was an x-large Styrofoam ice chest with the end smashed off. It's pretty obvious that McDonald's and Subway both offer what must be considered prime river-food as their packaging is mixed in at most places. The other thing is there are as many cans and bottles underwater as there are on the banks! The bottom of the river in sections off of premium shore access is literally covered with cans and bottles."

Meanwhile, Hank and Wu are tracking down leads back in Portland. After calling on Holly's distraught mother, Hank finds out that there's a link between the forest area and a former neighbor of Holly's. You don't need to be Monroe to know that this smells suspicious -- especially since the suspect, Addison, looks so guilty when Hank calls on him. Even more suspicious, Addison had an alibi the day Holly disappeared -- he had been bitten by a wild dog hiking on Mount Hood and was in the hospital. Ah, but what hospital? Beaverton Community Hospital! Why drive all the way to Beaverton when you're in terrible pain, Hank wonders. Poor Beaverton -- dissed again.

Mr. Putin's day of reckoning, his choice of an end game, may be years away, considering his many strengths. He has reasserted state control over much of Russia's oil wealth and has a loyal power base in the security services.

Other reasons the group gave for favoring self-employment included the desire to be their own boss, setting their own hours, increased security, the possibility for retirement income and the freedom that comes from running your own show.

Option 4. Build a dynasty, or a one-party state. Monarchies are one way to perpetuate iron-fisted rule; uncrowned autocrats find other means. Fidel Castro turned over dictatorial power in Cuba to his brother. Haydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan handed it off to his son. China's Communists have mastered the art of one-party rule and leadership turnover that worked smoothly for decades in Mexico and the Soviet Union. Leaders from such parties accept curbs on their personal power—China's presidents have term limits—but are less likely than personalist dictators to be overthrown, disgraced or betrayed by a successor.
"I think I've gotten maybe a little freer playing the piece. When I first learned it when I was about 21, I played it much more from the standpoint of a classical pianist. One of the things I've realized is, ‘Rhapsody in Blue' - unlike the traditional one cadenza that so many concertos have - has a whole bunch of them. There are several extended segments where the piano plays solo, and that allows you a certain degree of freedom."

At its most basic, it’s the story of the people’s fickle love, and a patrician’s discomfort with the rough-and-tumble of pragmatic politics.

Without such things it becomes simply… monotonous.

There are a lot of players on this Rams roster playing hurt. I think it would send a bad message to the rest of the team to treat a banged-up Sam Bradford any differently than the other players. But seeing Bradford in a walking boot after Wednesday's practice and seeing the frustration in his face, you have to wonder if he's going to be healthy enough to play in any of the final three games. It looks like there's no way he's playing this week. So I'd say see how the ankle feels next week, and if it's still iffy – or worse – shut him down.

Her performances are always marvels of technical virtuosity, and her mimicry can indeed be dazzling. One senses her own delight in capturing the likeness of another. Perhaps this is why as she has gotten older she has tended to favor comic masks over tragic ones.

The cylinder also screws into the iPhone case and can serve as a handle (to stabilize video), or provide a standard tripod mount.

"We had some wide receivers come in and it didn't happen. There are teams in the league that if you get in a bidding contest with certain teams in the league, it's almost impossible to win. And that's kind of what happened. It's not that we didn't try. It just didn't happen. We'll stick with our philosophy of building through the draft and signing our own free agents."

Of course, life has its compensations. Jake has the NFL career, but Josh got the looks and the brains. He has done some modeling (mostly print work), but that’s not in his long-term future. Indeed, when we made our final stop along our road to Super Bowl LXVI, here in the splendid suburbs of southwest Ohio, the last thing we expected to find in an NFL player’s kitchen was a textbook open to a page on hip anatomy.

We ended up being very wrong, of course: Of all those shaky defenses that entered this tournament, only one — the generous Belichicks of Foxborough — remains. Indeed, three of the teams in the Final Four are superb defensively, and in the age of offensive dominion, what conclusions should be drawn from this?

The Westminster restaurant is decidedly modern: deep blue tiles climb one wall as if to draw a high-water mark; a flat-screen TV recedes elegantly into the back of the dining room. It's a clean style cultivated by the Chau family, which runs Hoang Yen with a welcoming air. The result is an open and inclusive space where uniformed electricians lunch alongside young mothers, and businessmen pop in for takeout as they pass through Little Saigon.
The GOP, in large part, isn't displaying its usual anti-gay election-year demagoguery, and not just in the "pledge." As recently as 1995, a Republican-controlled Congress was holding hearings investigating "homosexual recruitment" and the "promotion" of homosexuality. During the George W. Bush administration, the party used its fervent opposition to marriage for gay and lesbian couples as a get-out-the-vote strategy, encouraging more than a dozen anti-gay state ballot initiatives geared at driving turnout in the 2004 election and engineering repeated efforts to pass an amendment to the Constitution. This year is the first election year in recent history in which anti-gay rhetoric has been significantly muted: No state is facing an anti-gay initiative on the ballot, and marriage has not been a focus of the national conservative agenda.

I started out at about a mile. A gentle mile. Then I started walking a little bit farther, after a week. Got a pedometer and got a sense of how long it takes to walk a mile. After a while you get to know the distance by how many steps you've taken in how many minutes. A mile to me is about 2,100 steps, at a pretty good clip -- about 15 minutes. Remember, this is your walk. You're not reporting to anyone or keeping score. It's all about burning some calories, speeding up your metabolism, strengthening your heart.

Christmas is a time for wines that you can enjoy through the day, so dig into the cellar (or the closet) for those special bottles you've been saving. Never was there a better time to share. It's also a time for more opulent flavors; as wonderful as a racy Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio (with a few exceptions) may be, you want wines that stand up to the sort of lavish recipes that require one last bit of traditional belt-loosening before the new year. If you want one all-purpose wine to serve during the day, choose Champagne. But why choose one wine?

Yes, Portland is experiencing a budget crisis. But because Americans have notoriously short memories, we should remember just how we got into this budget crisis in the first place. It wasn't because public workers' wages were too high, pensions too generous, or health care plans too expensive.

Wine of some sort has been made in North America since the 1500s. In the 1800s, there were significant commercial wineries in California, Missouri, Ohio and New York (Finger Lakes region), and those are just the biggies. Then two agricultural calamities -- Phylloxera and Pierce's Disease -- had a devastating effect on our vineyards. After that came the 18th Amendment, more commonly known as Prohibition, which pretty much took out commercial winemaking in the U.S. until the 1960s. By the '70s and '80s, advances in science and technology provided by University of California-Davis and other research facilities helped us take off in winemaking. Today (deserved or not), we hold a seat at the table of fine-wine producers around the world.

Here he is in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11: "We are apparently supposed to shut up and eat our spinach. Asking questions, proposing alternatives, making distinctions, arguing analogies, remembering history, or criticizing our stand-tall President is, for the moment, unpatriotic and maybe even unmanly.
